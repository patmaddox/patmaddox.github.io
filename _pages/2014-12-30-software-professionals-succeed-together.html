<h2>Can you forge your own path through the software industry?</h2>
<p>Most jobs that you will want require skills you don't have. You want those jobs because they present challenges to your current abilities.</p>
<p>This fact leaves you in one of two kinds of mindsets:</p>
<ul>
<li>stuck</li>
<li>problem-solving</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, you problem-solve all the time. Unfortunately, sometimes your decisions lead you down a dark alley of doubt.</p>
<p>This leads to you staying in the same job for years, in the same office building in the same office park, meeting with the same people and choosing between the same cafeteria and mall every day.</p>
<p>And that's cool, if you love it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you love your work? Or do you work so you can do what you love?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Working as a software professional can place you firmly in the realm of &quot;love your work&quot; - but you will sabotage yourself when you adopt an incorrect mindset.</p>
<p>How can a mindset be incorrect?</p>
<p>Simple: if you want to achieve something, and your mindset gets in the way of that, then that is an incorrect mindset.</p>
<p>You can debug something that is incorrect. You can make it correct so it delivers the results you want, every time.</p>
<p>What mindsets can you adopt? Here are a couple you've probably heard:</p>
<ul>
<li>businesses won't hire old people... or young people</li>
<li>women get driven out of the software industry by trolls</li>
<li>companies with billions of dollars get away with murder</li>
<li>businesses - startups in particular - face a talent shortage</li>
<li>you should work 50, 60, 70 hour weeks... or more, if you want to succeed</li>
</ul>
<p>While you have countless mindsets you can adopt and merge and tweak at any point, they fall into just a few categories.</p>
<p>You don't even have to think in categories - you just have to think about results.</p>
<p>Let's take a quick look at some of those mindsets you're familiar with, and see what kind of results they bring:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Random failure mindset #1: &quot;Businesses won't hire old people... or young people&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ageism happens, whether consciously or unconsciously. If you accept that companies won't hire you because of your age, you constantly worry about your age. You search for stability and fulfillment in your work but the process leaves you more uncertain and anxious than before.</p>
<p>When anything works against you, take a step back and reassess your strategy.</p>
<p>How can you make people's perception of age work in your favor?</p>
<p>I won't say &quot;it's that easy&quot; because we all know it's not.</p>
<p>But it is a simple idea that can produce the results that you want.</p>
<p>Simple and produces results is hard to do, which is why it looks easy from the outside, after the fact.</p>
<p>Examine the two mindsets: &quot;Businesses won't hire people too young or old&quot; vs &quot;Perception of age influences behavior&quot;</p>
<p>You now have a tool - a simple mindset shift - to get completely un-stuck and back to the business of problem-solving.</p>
<p>Instead of feeling stuck and wondering what to do next, you'll continue to experiment and learn and succeed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Random failure mindset #2: &quot;Women get driven out of the software industry by trolls&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>True story. Women face social challenges that can make them feel unwelcome and even threatened, and force them out as a matter of safety and sanity.</p>
<p>Women also created much of the foundational technology of our industry, and continue to drive the industry forward.</p>
<p>Given the world-changing accomplishments of people of all shapes and colors and types, it's fair to say that anyone can succeed if they find or create a positive working context for themselves.</p>
<p>By trying on a different mindset, you can start to build relationships with people and create new opportunities, and help teach people about the challenges you face as a unique individual.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Random failure mindset #3: &quot;Companies with billions in the bank get away with murder&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uber shocks tech-journalists each time a newer, dirtier story comes out, but with its 11-figure bank account and global expansion plans, nothing seems to be able to rein them in, morally.</p>
<p>Wealthy companies like Google and Yahoo all buy out little companies... and sometimes do nothing with them, or even kill them.</p>
<p>How do you get a job at a corporate place with a huge HR department that seemingly possesses no understanding of how to hire programmers?</p>
<p>Do you want to work at a corporate place vs a startup... or do you want to develop your own entrepreneurship?</p>
<p>Big-name businesses play a totally different game than we play.</p>
<p>They win because of volume, and size, and power.</p>
<p>We win because of margin (hustle ;), and scrappiness, and agility.</p>
<p>For all of the resources that any business has, they don't have you - unless you offer your services to them, and they accept.</p>
<h3>Whose destiny do you control? Uber's, Google's, or your own?</h3>
<p>You can derive immediate value one of two ways: by earning money, or learning.</p>
<p>Ideally, you do both as much as possible.</p>
<p>You can afford to learn, even if it doesn't feel like it sometimes (or even all of the time).</p>
<p>Although you need money, you don't need tens of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>This means you can make small bets that sometimes pay off and sometimes don't.</p>
<p>You never risk much, and you don't have to rely on hitting it big.</p>
<p>You just make simple choices that consistently yield the results you want.</p>
<p>Do you want to do a job you love?</p>
<p>I sure do!</p>
<p>Yet while we struggle to land or create the ideal dream job...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Random failure mindset #4: Businesses all over face a talent shortage - especially startups</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can't make anyone notice you, and businesses claim they can't find anyone to hire.</p>
<p>What's missing?</p>
<p>Have you considered that the talent isn't missing on the software side of things?</p>
<p>What's missing is the ability to identity, train, and manage talent, and give it room to flourish.</p>
<p>Of course if it were easy, everyone would be doing it and nobody would be complaining.</p>
<p>And you don't hear from the companies that thoughtfully hire new professionals as they need... they're too busy making interesting, profitable software to complain.</p>
<p>In fact, profitable software companies go about their business completely different from borrow-from-VCs-then-ipo startups.</p>
<p>One thing they don't do is say...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Random failure mindset #5: You should work 50, 60, 70 hour weeks... or more</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Startups are renowned for their insane time and energy demands, and the stress they cause. But that stress pales in comparison to... the glorious riches of startup success!</p>
<p>Unless, of course, you forget to get rich.</p>
<p>Or maybe you didn't forget to get rich, it just didn't happen for you.</p>
<p>Now you're stressed out, old (nobody hires old people, remember!), and still not rich.</p>
<p>VCs invest in companies knowing that many of them will fail. They play goofy financial tricks to create impressive appearances, but ultimately it's a bunch of money in a bunch of companies, most of which don't really do anything or make any money.</p>
<p>So they tell you, &quot;It's cutthroat! It's competitive! You must pour everything you have in to it so you can beat the odds.&quot;</p>
<p>Talk is cheap. Investing in a new startup usually isn't. Your life, your happiness, and the happiness of people you love... those are priceless.</p>
<p>(yeah, I said it :) )</p>
<p>When software professionals over-extend themselves, they make mistakes, they perform sub-optimally, and they burn out.</p>
<p>And I don't mean they, I mean &quot;we&quot; - because I've struggled through burn out more times than I can count. Many of my friends have felt the same way at times.</p>
<p>Everyone has a different story, but we share similar experiences.</p>
<p>You might feel that you can put in those kinds of hours, whether at a startup or in a 12-week bootcamp (I really can't imagine the thought of paying $20k for the privilege of working 70 hours per week, can you?)</p>
<p>You might be right. You might love it.</p>
<p>If you adopt and use mindsets mindfully, you can find that perfect fit.</p>
<p>I just caution you against buying into the claims that grueling schedules are the way to get ahead.</p>
<p>Plenty of people have gone a different route. You probably have, so far.</p>
<p>Or maybe you have plunked down $20k for a code school and didn't get the results you wanted.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Try it out</h1>
<p>Don't just take my word for it. Take a close look at your behaviors, and the mindsets that drive those behaviors.</p>
<p>Does your behavior, and the mindset behind it, produce the results you want?</p>
<p>If so, then just look to turn up the good.</p>
<p>But if not, you may have to take a step back and take a completely different approach.</p>
<p>Just list out a handful of things you do that don't generate the outcomes you want - whether they don't at all or are just not quite there yet.</p>
<p>Then take a step back for a moment and think of different mindsets and behaviors that can generate different outcomes - maybe the exact outcomes you want!</p>
<p>Of course, sometimes you get so stuck in your own perspective that you can't seem to think of any different possible mindsets.</p>
<p>In that case, it's useful to talk with someone. Which is why I want to know...</p>
