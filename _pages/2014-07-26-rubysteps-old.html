<h2>Take the next step today</h2>
<p>It's no secret: if you want to get good at programming, you have to write lots of programs. Tutorials and code schools can give you a foundation, but still leave you wondering: "What next...?"</p>
<p>â€¦ or you might not like the tutorials and code schools that are out there. Tutorials get out of date. When you run into problems, there's nobody to help out - you have to post a question to a blog or StackOverflow and hope that someone sees your question and is willing to help. Code schools sound like a great idea... if you've got the twenty grand and ability to move your life across the country for 6 months.</p>
<hr />
<p>When you're a programmer, there's always something new to learn. And the only way to learn is to work on new programming problems. You probably know that already, but you might be wondering how to make the best use of your limited time. How do you make sure that you're not just wasting time? After all, so many things are unclear:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should you learn Ruby before you learn Rails?</li>
<li>What kinds of programs can you create with Ruby and Rails?</li>
<li>How much Ruby knowledge do you need before you can get a job?</li>
<li>How do you create code examples that will impress future employers?</li>
<li>When should you learn TDD? OOP? Refactoring?</li>
<li>How do you get involved in open source?</li>
<li>How do you make the jump from junior to senior developer?</li>
</ul>
<p>The questions go on and on. What if you didn't even have to ask those questions in the first place? What if you could learn everything you needed to in order to be an effective programmer without even really thinking about all there is to learn?</p>
<hr />
<p>Despite what code schools tell you, there's no one straight path to success. Daily life as a programmer doesn't map neatly to the curriculums they post on their sites. You need to learn to deal with unexpected problems all the time. You need to learn the way a professional programmer does - by diving in and working on code.</p>
<p>I created RubySteps as a straightforward, cost-effective way for you to take the next step in your software career. It focuses on a daily coding practice, and gives you the tools and techniques you need in order to be a more effective programmer.</p>
<hr />
<h4>If you have never written a line of code in your life, you will get exposure to a real development environment and start solving programming problems immediately.</h4>
<h4>If you have worked through tutorials, books, or code schools, you will practice what you've learned and solidify your understanding of programming concepts and techniques.</h4>
<h4>If you are looking for your first job, you will refine your abilities and create an effective portfolio.</h4>
<h4>If you're ready to take the next step in your career, you will hone your skills and develop the expertise you need in order to take on bigger technical challenges.</h4>
<hr />
<p>Paid subscribers receive a weekly series of lessons on the following topics:</p>
<ul>
