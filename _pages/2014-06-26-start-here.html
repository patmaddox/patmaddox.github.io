<p>You can view blog posts by date on the right, or search for terms that interest you.</p>
<p>On this page you'll find some articles that will give you a good idea of the kinds of things I think about.</p>
<h2>What does it mean to "deliver value"?</h2>
<p>It should be as simple as building what users want, right? Why do some projects fail to pay for themselves even though developers are cranking out features? <a href="http://patmaddox.com/2010/05/19/are-you-punching-your-users-in-the-face/">Are you punching your users in the face?</a></p>
<h2>The hidden value of the Agile Manifesto</h2>
<p>The Agile Manifesto provides a clear set of values to guide software teams. <a href="http://patmaddox.com/2011/10/12/the-hidden-agile-value-respect/">One un-named value underscores the whole thing</a>.</p>
<h2>Read to Learn</h2>
<p>If you want something to keep you busy, I've got a list of books that you might want to check out. I'm not calling this an exhaustive or a necessary list of books to read, just ones that I've found helpful in my studies as a programmer. See my <a href="http://patmaddox.com/2012/03/27/some-books-for-software-oriented-humans/">books for software-oriented humans</a>.</p>
<h2>Amplify learning with focused habits</h2>
<p>My father's educational habits greatly influenced mine. Learn more about them in <a href="http://patmaddox.com/2011/07/26/one-doctors-model-for-continuing-education/">One doctor's model for continuing education</a>.</p>
<h2>Taking on testing lore</h2>
<p>I make a framework vanish with a dozen lines of code in <a href="http://patmaddox.com/2014/05/15/poof-and-then-rails-was-gone/">*poof* … and then Rails was gone</a>. DHH's counter-argument is nowhere to be found, either.</p>
<h2>Ending the debate on private methods</h2>
<p>…once and for all! <a href="http://patmaddox.com/2008/10/27/testing-protected-and-private-methods-in-ruby/">Testing protected and private methods in Ruby</a></p>
<h2>Do I need to be a craftsman? What do they mean by "passion"?</h2>
<p><a href="http://patmaddox.com/2011/01/20/weighing-in-on-software-craftsmanship/">What is software craftsmanship?</a></p>
<h2>Sometimes you're $stdout, sometimes you're $stderr</h2>
<p>Any success comes after overcoming countless challenges. I reflect on some of my own in <a href="http://patmaddox.com/2014/03/14/fear-of-failure/">Fear of Failure</a></p>
<h2>I done messed up. Where is the love?</h2>
<p>I'll just say it… I'm not sure what it is that I'll say, but I know I'll say it. I think we need to understand that people mess up and that what's important is how we respond. <a href="http://patmaddox.com/2013/03/21/how-id-like-to-handle-my-future-public-fuck-up/">How I'd like to handle my future public fuck up</a>.</p>
<h2>How to get 10x better at programming with 1/2 the effort</h2>
<p>I love pair programming. Or do I? <a href="http://patmaddox.com/2013/11/21/why-not-to-pair/">It's up to you to figure out :)</a></p>
<h2>When things get tangled, it's time to decouple</h2>
<p>Let's get nerdy for a bit. You can simplify your testing practices by tweaking one configuration in Rails. <a href="http://patmaddox.com/2007/11/23/better-rails-testing-decoupling-observers/">Better Rails Testing - Decoupling Observers</a></p>
<h2>When you just can't keep DRY</h2>
<p>You might think duplication is evil, but you can use it to your advantage. Learn how in <a href="http://patmaddox.com/2008/07/23/when-duplication-in-tests-informs-design/" title="When Duplication in Tests Informs Design">When Duplication in Tests Informs Design</a></p>

<h2>Oozing OOP</h2>
<p>Highly objectionable! Let's go deep on design in <a href="http://patmaddox.com/2009/08/29/to-be-an-object-or-not-to-be-that-is-the-question/">To Be an Object, or Not to Be, That Is the Question</a></p>
<h2>Speaking of deep design…</h2>
<p>Want to save time and money, and expose risk points early? <a href="http://patmaddox.com/2006/12/19/design-deep-not-wide/">Design Deep, Not Wide</a></p>
<h2>Behavior and persistence, sitting in a tree</h2>
<p>They say not to mix concerns. How could something so wrong feel so right? <a href="http://patmaddox.com/2010/10/29/behavioral-methods-in-activerecord/">Behavioral Methods in ActiveRecord</a>.</p>
<h2>Test-driven javascript interfaces using a simple testing pattern</h2>
