<p><b>Yeah right!</b> Not with all the gems and the trains and the coffees and the snakes and the dragons and the elephants and the databases and the javascripts, the editor wars, the consoles, the packages, the log files, the test frameworks, the web frameworks, the emails, the twitters, the servers, the frontends, the backends... and the <b>***** error messages!!!</b></p>
<p><b>You've looked everywhere for help</b>. People tell you to try books, tutorials, courses, and sample apps - <b>you've done it all</b>. You even had a mentor for a bit, but he flaked on you. What else can you do? <b>You don't exactly have ten thousand bucks for a bootcamp</b>.</p>
<p><b>You worry that you're wasting your time</b>. You keep learning new things...and then forgetting them. <b>Things just keep breaking</b> out of nowhere and the blog posts that helped you a month ago <b>don't work for you anymore</b>. You're using up all your energy trying to keep things straight in your head, and it's keeping you from doing what you really want: <b>make cool stuff</b>.</p>
