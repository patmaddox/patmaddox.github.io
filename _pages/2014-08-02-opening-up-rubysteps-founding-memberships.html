<p>For the next three days, I am offering an 80% discount on Founding Memberships for <a href="http://patmaddox.com/rubysteps/">RubySteps</a>. Read on for details.</p>
<hr />
<p>You've seen what's out there: the code schools, the tutorials, the bootcamps. They're great resources, but they all have one major problem in common: when you get stuck, you get REALLY stuck. You search the documentation, you search the web, you put everything you have into making it past this one error...and then WHAM - you get another error, another punch to the gut.</p>
<p>You don't want to get stuck, and you really don't want punches to the gut. You want to get better. Challenge is good, but at some point the computer just starts beating you down. Don't let it win!</p>
<p>You might have heard that you need to "learn X the hard way." Bullshit. This stuff IS hard. There is no easy way, anywhere. EVERY way is "the hard way."</p>
<p>You have probably also heard, "Work smarter, not harder." What if you could work smarter, AND harder? What if you WANTED to work harder because you knew that it would pay off? What if by working smarter, you could work EXACTLY as hard as you wanted to, whenever you wanted to?</p>
<p>Let me tell you what's not so smart, or fun:</p>
<p>* staring at error messages for hours on end, watching the characters morph in front of your bleary eyes<br />
* overlooking the exact information you need to solve your problem, when it's staring you in the face<br />
* giving up and hoping stack overflow will come through for you in the next 2 hours<br />
* struggling with a problem that someone else can solve in seconds, just because they've seen it before<br />
* reading the same tutorials over and over, hoping it sticks, and having none of your own code to show for it<br />
* learning new bits and pieces without ever DOING anything with them, building a portfolio of "I-wish-I-coulds" and "wouldn't-it-be-cools"<br />
* surfing job boards endlessly, either never landing an interview or never passing one</p>
<p>I like to work smart. It's FUN to work smart. It's taken me a long time and a lot of sweat to learn how to work smart. I've been fortunate to have met and worked with some insanely smart people, and I've stolen every trick and bit of knowledge and wisdom from them as I possibly can. I've been fortunate to share what I've learned with people all over the world.</p>
<p>I've seen what happens when you work smart. I've seen the first great programmer I worked with - the one I've learned the most from in my life so far - solve problems in ways that blew away the inventors of the technologies meant to solve those problems in the first place. I saw him predict a future for himself: living in the city, studying ancient literature in one of the top graduate programs in the world, making art. I saw him make it happen. I've seen so many people change their lives through programming, and I continue to see and meet those people every day. People like me. People like my friends. People like you.</p>
<p>I've seen what happens when you don't work smart. I've seen people burn out, and wash out. I've seen friends sacrifice their health and their family relationships to serve a company, only to have the rug pulled from underneath them. I've seen people get stuck in dead-end jobs, depressed and hopeless. You don't think there are dead-end jobs in software? Think again. Most people who hire programmers don't know anything about programming, but they do know business, and they do know how to get value for cheap. You don't want to be some ignorant businessman's cheap labor, trust me.</p>
<p>You have options. Endless options. Your options change with every decision you make. Not necessarily for the better, or for the worse, just different every time. You can add RubySteps to your learning toolbox, or you can choose not to.</p>
<p>If you choose RubySteps, it will make a difference to you. You will develop a daily practice of excellence and exploration. You will gain new skills and techniques and the ability to solve increasingly challenging problems. You will join a community of like-minded practitioners of all experience and skill levels all around the world. You will take a small step, with huge potential outcomes.</p>
<p>If you choose RubySteps, it will make a difference to me. You will give me endless energy and confidence as I continue my work educating people about how to build a powerful career in software through working smarter.</p>
<p>I can't say exactly what your options will be after joining RubySteps and practicing the program. Everyone has a different story, and so everyone's story with RubySteps will be different. I can't wait to learn the stories of even more of the people who participate in RubySteps, and follow them as they progress.</p>
<p>If you've ever been in an educational program and wondered, "when do we get to the good stuff?", I've got some good news. For me the answer is: RIGHT NOW, ALL THE TIME! I have seen what happens when you throw people into an unfamiliar environment: they adapt. This programming stuff isn't so hard. You could be getting chased by a bear. I'd rather write computer programs than run for my life from a bear. You can sit down, and you can read, and you can run the example programs with as little frustration as possible. Then you can experiment. You can ask yourself questions. You can ask the other RubySteps members questions. You can ask me questions. You can take it as far as you want, and drop it whenever you like. You can wake up tomorrow and do it again, getting a little bit better every day. That's how you get to be a great programmer. You take small steps, and when you see something you don't understand, you say "How fascinating" and figure out how your understanding differs from reality.</p>
<p>I can't make the errors go away (not entirely, anyway), but I can show you how to make them hurt less. I can show you how to learn to avoid problems, not by predicting the future, but by simply working smarter. I can share my stories and advice with you when you have problems, and I can introduce you to a community of amazing people who would love to help you along your journey.</p>
<p>Starting now, I'm offering RubySteps memberships for just $29/month. You will get all the same great interactive lessons you've been getting this week, plus exclusive access to some other things I have up my sleeve (look for the email about Mob Learning coming to you next week).</p>
<p>I'm only making this offer available through the weekend. Actually, I'll do you one better: I'll make it available until Monday. The deadline is 6 hours after I send out Monday's free lesson on Ruby. I'm keeping it short because I want to practice what I preach and dive in now. Do what I can, with what I have, get better, and learn from others through serving them.</p>
<p>After that, the price goes up to $149/month (I'm considering another deal for people who are still on the fence, but it won't be nearly as good as the one I'm offering you now). Most of all, you won't have access to the lessons every weekday, or the great stuff I have in store. But you'll still get one free lesson each week, along with code examples and explanations the rest of the week. I still want you to get great stuff from me for free.</p>
<p>That's it. You've got some time to think about it. But not much. If you're in, you're in. After that, you miss out on the in-depth lessons, the members-only opportunities, and this one-time chance to get all of that for the price of a McDonald's family meal each month (you're better off not knowing).</p>
<p>There's no obligation. You can cancel at any time. If you're not completely satisfied with RubySteps, let me know and I will refund your last payment. You have my email address, and you can ask me anything you'd like, any time you'd like.</p>
