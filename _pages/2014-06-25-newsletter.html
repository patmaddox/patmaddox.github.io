<p>You've seen the expensive coding schools - $20k for a 6 week course. That's great if they get you a job, but 6 weeks isn't much time to explore the endless possibilities of programming. What? You don't have $20k to throw down? What if you could teach yourself, save time and money, and maximize your chances of finding a job - or better yet, build those ideas you've been dreaming about?</p>
