<h4>Seriously good stuff</h4>
<p>I did a podcast with my buddy Dave Brady. <a href="http://addcasts.com" target="_blank">All the episodes are online</a> for your viewing pleasure.</p>
<h2>Growing Up Agile</h2>
<h4>Agile Roots 2010</h4>
<p>In 2000, Agile was revolutionary. In 2010, Agile is stagnant. There are two Agile worlds today: The first is pushing the same practices and processes they've been pushing for the last decade. The second takes many of these practices and processes for granted. Sadly, there's little interaction between the two. In this discussion, we'll look at the rift between the two communities, how to bridge it, and the exciting possibilities that can exist when we do.</p>

<h2>Working Effectively with Legacy Rails Code</h2>
<h4>Scotland on Rails 2009</h4>
<p>Rails has powered Oakley.com, a site generating tens of millions of dollars in revenue for the past two years. It has 80 models, an equal number of controllers, 75k lines of code…and no tests. I will talk about how we’ve been chipping away at growing an effective, valuable test suite since I’ve come on with Oakley. How can we take a mass of untested code that runs our businesses, and start working to the ideal of high-quality, malleable, tested code, while still meeting the demands of high productivity in our daily work? My talk will get people thinking and talking about that process, and give them practical techniques for making it reality.</p>
