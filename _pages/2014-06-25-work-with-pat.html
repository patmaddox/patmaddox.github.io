<p>I have spent the past decade learning how to ship software and deliver value. I work with teams all over the world to learn how to achieve more by doing less. I believe that great software happens when you focus on the people who make it and the environment they work in.</p>
<p>If you're interested in working with me in some way, whether it be consulting, training, coaching, code-for-hire, or speaking at a conference or user group, please fill out the form below and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Pat</p>
