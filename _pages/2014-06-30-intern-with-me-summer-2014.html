<p>Looking for something better to do this summer than endless tutorials and trashy beach novels? Consider interning with me. I am looking for someone who wants to create lots of awesome software. I don't care if you've never written a line of code in your life or if you're a grizzled neckbeard. If you think you might be interested, just fill out the form below and I'll be in touch. I'll make sure you still have time for trashy beach novels :)</p>
