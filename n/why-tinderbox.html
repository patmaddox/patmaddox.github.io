<h1>Why Tinderbox?</h1>
<p>I’m using Tinderbox for this site because I like the idea of incremental formalization. I’m a fairly messy thinker. I have all kinds of hobbies. I don’t have a clear direction for where I’m going with something. Usually, I just live life, try some stuff, and figure out what it means later.</p>
<p>Tinderbox seems uniquely suited for working in this way.</p>
