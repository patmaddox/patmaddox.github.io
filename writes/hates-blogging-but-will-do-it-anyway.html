<h1>Pat Maddox hates blogging, but will do it anyway.</h1>


<p><b>3 minute read</b></p>


<p>I love to write. I write basically every day. I don’t have a word count goal or anything like that… I’m just in the habit of writing.</p>
<p>Back in 2005 (!!), <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20051105050918/flpr.org">I started a blog to share my exploration of the FLPR stack</a> – FreeBSD, lighttpd, PostgreSQL, and Ruby on Rails. I don’t know if anyone ever read it, or if anyone even used the stack besides me. I wrote mostly for myself though – because I enjoy writing, and because documenting my progress helps me learn.</p>
<p>Two years later, I decided FLPR was too niche and started a more general blog called “<a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20070114021507/http://evang.eli.st:80/blog/">evang.eli.st – utterly unqualified opinions on software</a>.” At the time, I had only had one programming job, which involved me converting a ColdFusion application to PHP. I didn’t enjoy the project itself much, but I worked with <a href="https://twitter.com/robotdeathsquad">one of my best friends</a> and got paid to program. I wrote <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20070206012120/http://evang.eli.st:80/blog/2006/11/29/smart-people-need-smart-servants">my first blog post</a> in the hopes that it would get me a job. It didn’t, but it did get me started on the path of writing and publishing regularly.</p>
<p>Eventually I got tired of awkwardly vocalizing my domain name, and decided I’d better just <a href="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20090214035120/patmaddox.com">use my own name</a>. I kept doing my thing, writing and publishing. I did that for over 10 years (!!) and now here I am… starting fresh.</p>
<h2>I hate blogging, seriously.</h2>
<p><i>Thanks for the history lesson, Pat… but why do you hate blogging?</i></p>
<p>Well, I’ll tell you.</p>
<p>I think it boils down to how my brain works, and how the internet works, which I think are basically the same thing. I get an idea (from someone else). I get another idea (from another someone else). I get more ideas. The ideas grow, and smash into one another, and change shape. They tug at each other, break, merge, multiply, and mutate. I don’t know how it happens, but it does, and I like it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28GLa9T2CtI">I like it a lot</a>.</p>
<p>Blogging doesn’t work that way, or at least has never worked that way for me. Blogging happens chronologically… I write a post on November 1st, and then another post on November 2nd. That’s how I wrote it, and that’s how you see it. But it’s not how I think, and that bothers me.</p>
<p>What happens when I think of something to add to the November 1st post, but now it’s November 3rd? Do I write a new blog post, and link back to the first one. Do I update the original post? If so, do I point out the update? What if you first read the post on November 5th, and never knew that I had updated it in the first place?</p>
<p>That’s a lot of questions for something that might be a trivial update. Whether I make a small change or a big change doesn’t even matter. The bigger problem I have is asking those questions in the first place. They create enough mental friction for me that I don’t want to deal with it.</p>
<p>I’m probably overthinking that stuff. I’ve been doing this long enough to know that I’m not going to stop. I need to address the problems I’ve identified. They get in the way of me writing and publishing, and that’s not cool.</p>
<h2>My knowledge grows. My writing should grow with it.</h2>
<p>The chronological paradigm of blogging poses an even bigger problem for me though. What if I don’t just want to add some details to a blog post… what if I want to represent what I actually know about a subject?</p>
<p>Content management systems have always had pages, which do the trick. In fact I’m pretty sure those existed long before blogs entered the Internet consciousness. That’s where I’m headed – getting back to basics, creating simple HTML pages.</p>
<p>A web page’s value can increase over time… by adding and removing content, restructuring the page, adding links. Maybe a single paragraph becomes a page, becomes a whole collection of pages. My thinking grows that way. I want my writing to grow that way too.</p>
<h2>I have a way forward.</h2>
<p>Fortunately, I have inspiration from <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com">Martin Fowler</a>, who keeps a “<a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/WhatIsaBliki.html">bliki</a>.” It’s a cross between a wiki and a blog, as the name suggests. I think he has the same sort of problems with blogs that I do:</p>
<blockquote>“I find writing too hard to want to spend it on things that disappear” -Martin Fowler</blockquote>
<p>To build my website again, I’ll use another thing I learned from Mr. Fowler: <a href="https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html">Refactoring</a>. Put simply, my process from here on out is:</p>
<ol><li> write</li>
<li> publish</li>
<li> refactor</li></ol>
<p>We’ll see how it works out. I suspect it will be pretty good.</p>
