<p>Making the decision to move from your current job to a new, rewarding job that you love can scare the hell out of you.</p>
<p>How do you know which technologies you should learn? Ask around, and you get a laundry list of old and new hotness: Ruby on Rails, Postgres, MongoDB, node.js (io.js?), Angular.js, Ember.js ... lots of dot.js&#39;es. Devops, testing frameworks, continuous integration - it will take you years to learn everything, and it will all change underneath you before you even get a chance to learn it all.</p>
<p>What if you could discover exactly which technologies you need to learn, not just to &quot;get a job&quot;... but to get your dream job?</p>
<p>What if you had a roadmap for learning the technologies that you would wield at your next job, and beyond?</p>
<p>You could do your work every day, confident that the time you put in will pay off.</p>
<p>You could learn things that will directly benefit you in your future work.</p>
<p>You would stay motivated, knowing that you&#39;re on a successful track - and not some stranger&#39;s idea of success, but YOUR idea of success.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, you can create this roadmap in less time than it takes to read this blog post :)</p>
<p>All you have to do is write down the list of technologies used at the job you want.</p>
<p>It sounds crazy simple, I know. And it is! Here&#39;s how you do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>write down the name of a company you would LOVE to work for</li>
<li>research their technology stack - check out their dev blog, follow their developers on Twitter, see what they contribute to on GitHub</li>
<li>write down the technology stack in a single list</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#39;s it, really!</p>
<p>Do this, and you will move from the daily uncertainty of &quot;what do I need to learn so that companies will hire me?&quot; to a confident position of &quot;when I learn this technology stack, I can make an impact at company X.&quot;</p>
<p>What will that mean for you?</p>
<p>Can you see the difference in the open-ended, &quot;how do I get hired?&quot; approach you&#39;ve been taking so far, and the ambitious-but-fixed-scope of &quot;I can add value to the company of my dreams if I just learn X, Y, and Z&quot;?</p>
<p>You can get a rough idea of the technologies in play in just five minutes. With an hour or two of research, you can build a solid idea of the technologies you need to learn, and a roadmap for learning them.</p>
<p>What would it mean to you to get hired by the company you dream of working for, as opposed to whatever company would take you?</p>
<p>Stop playing the &quot;I hope somebody hires me&quot; game. Start playing a new game: a game where you consciously select which companies bid for you - regardless of your experience level.</p>
<p>Do you know the company you want to work for? Can you create a roadmap to get you there? Do you have any questions on getting there? Please <a href="mailto:pat@rubysteps.com">email me</a> with notes on the work you&#39;ve done, and I will do my very best to help you.</p>
