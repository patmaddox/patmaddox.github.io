<p>Dear 19-year-old Pat,</p>
<p>This is 29-year-old Pat. Calm down, you haven&#39;t invented time travel! I just want to share some things that will make your life a bit easier... but knowing how stubborn you are, you&#39;ll spend the next ten years figuring this stuff out for yourself anyway.</p>
<h2>Trust yourself</h2>
<p>Your world grows bigger and richer with every moment. You can&#39;t possibly understand everything that&#39;s going on around you. Keep learning, and do your best to make good decisions... but know that you&#39;ll get things wrong way more often than you&#39;ll get them right.</p>
<h2>You can always count on family</h2>
<p>I know this is the last thing in the world you&#39;ll believe right now, but it&#39;s true (trust me!). The next few years will be some of the hardest, but you&#39;ll make it through. Call your mom. Call your dad. Call your brother.</p>
<p>You&#39;ve gone to 9 schools across 3 continents. You&#39;ve had to leave your friends, and start all over again, every few years. Everything around you will get turned upside down, like clockwork. The one constant in your life is your family - they will be with you every step of the way.</p>
<p>Things are really fucked up for you right now, I get that. This too shall pass.</p>
<h2>Dream like a boy, live like a man</h2>
<p>What goes on inside your head is your own business. Let your freak flag fly. When it comes time to interact with other people, recognize the immense power you have to shape their experience.</p>
<p>You grew up with amazing role models, and you will encounter plenty more. Don&#39;t get sucked in to other people&#39;s bullshit ideas about what it means to be a man. There&#39;s a reason that &quot;gentle&quot; comes first in &quot;gentleman&quot;.</p>
<h2>When someone treats you poorly, GTFO</h2>
<p>Sadly, the world is full of abusers and manipulators. Their #1 goal is to hide their true selves from you. When people reveal their true selves to you, believe them. GTFO as fast as you can, and don&#39;t look back.</p>
<h2>Forgive yourself</h2>
<p>You will hurt people - sometimes intentionally. Don&#39;t be surprised when they GTFO.</p>
<p>You&#39;re not a bad person. You&#39;re just human. Don&#39;t beat yourself up so much. You don&#39;t have to feel guilty, as long as you learn.</p>
<p>When you do hurt people, recognize that it stems directly from your ability to create so much love in the first place.</p>
<h2>Love</h2>
<p>You will lose people that you love deeply. When that happens, you will forget all of the bad stuff. You will only remember all of the love that they brought in to your life.</p>
<p>The major decisions you make will force you to pit love against fear. Choose love every time, and you&#39;ll be fine.</p>
<h2>Make your own rules</h2>
<p>You didn&#39;t ask to be brought in to this world. Nobody knows what happens when you&#39;re done. You only get one shot! Make sure that when it&#39;s all over, you can say that the only person who could have possibly lived that life is Pat Maddox.</p>
<p>&lt;3 Pat</p>
