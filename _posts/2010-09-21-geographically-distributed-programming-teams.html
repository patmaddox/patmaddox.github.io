<p>I spent a year working on a team that was distributed across four time zones.  During the first six months I worked from home, and then I moved up to where the company&#8217;s headquarters are located for the final six months.  I&#8217;m not going to rehash arguments about distributed teams here, I just want to share some of my personal feelings as a result of my experience.</p>
<h3>1. Remote pair programming sucks</h3>
<p>The technology just isn&#8217;t there yet to make remote pair programming consistently enjoyable for me.  I feel like I operated at about 70% the effectiveness when pairing remotely as I did in-person.  That&#8217;s probably being generous.  Remote pairing is extremely frustrating compared to in-person (and that&#8217;s just the technology - it doesn&#8217;t take into account your pair&#8217;s mood that day!)  Moreover, we had tough times synching up to pair.  Because of our meeting schedule, we&#8217;d typically have one hour to pair in the morning.  Then the east coast guy would go to lunch, and when he got back the west coast guy was taking off soon.  Maybe another hour or two of pairing in the afternoon before east coast guy logs off for the day.  Result: not very much pairing.</p>
<h3>2. Culture is important</h3>
<p>One of the most profound experiences I&#8217;ve had was working on a for-fun weeklong agile project when Dale Emery rang a little bell to announce that he had pushed a new feature to production.  He explained briefly what it was, everyone clapped, and went back to work.  After that, people started ringing the bell to announce new deploys.  It was fun to have a moment to take credit for your work and receive the warm fuzzies from your team&#8217;s applause.  If warm fuzzies don&#8217;t interest you, you might appreciate the rapid knowledge transfer that occurred as a result.  In 10 seconds, the entire team got an update on the current state of the product.  If the announcement sounded like it could affect a pair&#8217;s work-in-progress, they could flag down the announcer and have a chat to sort things out.</p>
<p>The key takeaway for me was that the Agilistry deploy bell developed organically.  There was no proclamation that &#8220;though shalt ring the deploy bell upon deployment.&#8221;  Even after Dale did it, nobody said, &#8220;hey we should all do that from now on.&#8221;  Well maybe someone did, I&#8217;m not sure, but it certainly didn&#8217;t get codified up in any guidelines or something like that.  Dale rang the bell and talked briefly.  Then later someone else did it, and it snowballed from there.</p>
<p>One of my favorite things about working in teams is growing as a group.  I am of course interested in developing my personal skills, but I think it&#8217;s more interesting to be a part of a team that gels and evolves from day to day.  I think that kind of gelling is much tougher when the team is remote, and the evolution a lot slower.</p>
<h3>3. Partially distributed teams need even more communication</h3>
<p>At RubyWebConf a few weeks ago, someone made the comment that a partially distributed team has tougher communications challenges than a fully distributed team does.  That seems to fit with my experience.  When one or two people on the team are in the office and talking with the business people all day long, they get a lot more information than the rest of the team does.  This can cause problems when a few of the team members are in sync and the rest are out of sync, or sometimes the remote guys get anxious because they know that there are conversations going on without them.  There was more than one occasion where someone&#8217;s whole workday to that point was wasted effort because the PM decided to change the requirements, but nobody remembered to tell the guy working on it.  Hey, they&#8217;re easy to forget sometimes, with nothing but a line item in Campfire to represent them.</p>
<p>A lot of teams are experimenting with going partially or entirely remote and are having varying degrees of success.  I want to pair program all the time, and I like working in a room and talking face to face with my team, and sketching ideas out on paper or a whiteboard.  So for the most part, I&#8217;m not interested in working in a long-term distributed team.  Different people are going to make different tradeoffs than I am.  And I know there&#8217;s a lot of work going into solving some of the challenges that I touched on.  <a href="http://avdi.org">Avdi Grimm</a> runs his <a href="http://wideteams.com/">Wide Teams blog</a> with lots of articles and interviews about managing distributed teams (including an article on <a href="http://wideteams.com/practices/intentional-culture/">building an intentional culture</a>).  <a href="http://agilefaqs.com/nareshjain.html">Naresh Jain</a> talks about distributed Agile a lot - <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/nashjain/distributed-agile">here&#8217;s a good slideshow</a> from him on the subject.  If you&#8217;re interested in making your distributed teams more effective, I suggest starting at those web pages.</p>
