<p>I have always been a big reader.  When I was a kid I used to stay up until 2am reading, and I always had a pile of books at the foot of my bed.  When the Kindle came out a few years ago, I had to have one.  Carrying around thousands of books at once?  Yes please.  Downloading new books and periodicals at the click of a button?  Don&#8217;t mind if I do.  Some people will argue that you don&#8217;t <em>need</em> to carry thousands of books at a time, and they&#8217;re probably right.  My kindle has about 75 items on it.  I generally read between 3 and 5 books at a time, because I have ADD and feel like reading something different every day, or at different times in the same day.  Being able to carry those around with me in one device is a big win.</p>
<p>For the most part, I stick to non-fiction.  My goal in reading any book is to acquire new information, or ideally to elevate my understanding.  Those are different goals, and a lot of books that satisfy the first don&#8217;t satisfy the second.  Either way, in order to get the most out of a book, I follow a basic process:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, I do a quick skim of the book, reading the table of contents, the index, intros and conclusions of chapters, the final few pages of the book, and just generally flipping through to find interesting sections or visuals.</li>
<li>Next I read through the book as quickly as I can, bookmarking pages that seem important or are difficult to understand.  I may highlight short passages for later reference, but I don&#8217;t really take notes at this point.</li>
<li>Once I&#8217;ve finished the book, I go back and look over the sections that gave me difficulty.  This is where I begin to go into more depth, taking notes, writing down my questions and trying to figure out the answers to them.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process comes pretty much straight from How to Read a Book by Mortimer Adler.  I tell you what, friends give you funny looks when they see that book on your desk.  I don&#8217;t mind though, because since I started reading this way, I am able to go through books faster than I was able to before, and I get a lot more out of them.  Presumably this is the sort of skill I would have learned in college, but I didn&#8217;t attend for long enough.</p>
<h3>Digital formats change the way I read</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using this process on paper books for a long time.  It&#8217;s taken me a while to completely adapt it to digital books.  At first I tried to pick a single platform to handle all of my reading.  The biggest problem is that every digital reader has some strengths and weaknesses.  The kindle provides the best reading experience for me.  I think the e-ink is gorgeous, and over all it is the closest I can get to a real book.  It&#8217;s better than a real book in a lot of ways, because the computer books I like to read are hefty and awkward to hold.  The kindle has one glaring weakness for me: navigation.  I can set bookmarks and highlight passages, and fairly easily jump between them, but it isn&#8217;t as natural or efficient as dog-earing pages or sticking my fingers in between the pages to hold a spot.  The kindle provides an excellent linear reading experience, but I find it cumbersome to jump back and forth between different parts of the book.</p>
<p>The other major downside to kindle is the DRM-protected books you buy from amazon.com.  I understand why companies do DRM, especially for a technology as new as e-readers, where nobody has a secure hold on the market yet.  But the promise of digital books to me is that I can read content on a number of devices, each with different capabilities.  Amazon has a kindle reader for basically every platform, but each one is still locked down with DRM, and most importantly I am limited by amazon&#8217;s ability and willingness to provide features.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started to buy more ebooks directly from publishers rather than amazon, because publishers often let you download the book in more than one format.  Pragmatic Press comes to my mind first, but there are others such as Smashwords who have recently made all of <a href="http://www.smashwords.com/profile/view/JerryWeinberg">Gerald Weinberg&#8217;s excellent books</a> available in PDF and Kindle format for only 10 bucks.  This is important to me because my process for reading digital books, after a good bit of trial and error, looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Load up the PDF on my computer and do my pre-reading, studying the table of contents and index, and skimming the book a little</li>
<li>Read through the book on my kindle as quickly as possible, bookmarking difficult pages or highlighting interesting passages</li>
<li>Return to my computer to go into the book in more detail, take notes, and all that</li>
</ol>
<p>Steps 1 and 2 involve randomly accessing the book&#8217;s contents.  This is not the kindle&#8217;s strong point, in my experience.  On the other hand, kindle kicks ass when reading linearly, which is what step 2 is all about.</p>
<p>In addition to random access, PDF&#8217;s strong point is that it&#8217;s a standard format with excellent tool support.  I have a simple use for it, creating rich text notes and copying the links to particular pages of a PDF to embed in the note, or just copying and pasting text from the PDF into the note.  There are more advanced annotation tools that let you add annotations directly to the PDF, if that interests you.</p>
<p>When I can download a single book in multiple formats, I have the best of all worlds.  Kindle lets me burn through books quickly and comfortably, with an easy mechanism for bookmarks and highlights to refer to later.  PDF lets me pull it up on my computer and jump around, or copy and paste text and images, or links to specific pages.  The multiple formats allow me to use the best tool for the job, so to speak.  Because of this, I have tended to purchase non-fiction books directly from publishers that let me download a PDF version in addition to a kindle version.  I find that I simply get more value from my reading when I can read books in this way.</p>
<h3>What does this mean for readers?</h3>
<p>I am interested to see how the digital book revolution plays out.  I suspect that more authors will move toward self-publishing, for a variety of reasons.  One is that they have more control over how their content is distributed.  I think creative folks are coming around to the idea that it&#8217;s more important that their work gets exposure to a large number of people than it is to be fairly compensated by every single person who consumes that work.  Put another way, most authors would rather sell 100k copies of a digital book and have 300k stolen copies out there, than sell 50k copies and have zero piracy.  I have no clue if that scenario is realistic, but the point is that if you can earn double the revenue and have 8x the readership, then you&#8217;d be silly to focus your efforts on combating piracy.</p>
<p>The other reason is that I&#8217;m pretty sure traditional publishing is dead unless they embrace technology much more than they have so far.  As Jeremy McAnnally points out in his eBook <a href="http://authoringebooks.com/">Authoring eBooks</a>, he was able to publish his Rails 3 upgrade guide right as Rails was released, but the first dead-tree books didn&#8217;t hit stores until a year later.  Many books, especially technical books, are available as &#8220;rough cuts&#8221; or something similar, but there&#8217;s no denying that the publishing industry in general moves at a snail&#8217;s pace when compared with digital publishing.</p>
<h3>What about you?</h3>
<p>I am curious to know what other people think.  How are you reading books these days?  Are you addicted to digital readers or do you still prefer paper books?  If you do read digital books, what influences your purchasing decisions?  Is it convenience, price, availability of formats, or something else?  For authors or aspiring authors, how do you plan to publish your content in this day and age?</p>
