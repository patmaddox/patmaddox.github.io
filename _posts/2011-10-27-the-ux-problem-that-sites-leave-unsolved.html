<p>Most sites give you basic account management. GitHub’s organizations allow multiple people to administer an account and manage projects within it. When nobody pays the bills, GitHub lets you know. They put up this big banner alerting all project admins that the private repositories are frozen until you update the credit card.</p>
<p><img src="assets/github-billing-error-message.jpg" title="GitHub’s billing error message" /></p>
<p>Fair enough. I’m not going to solve this billing problem though. The account belongs to someone I worked with a while back who added me to the repository. If they want to address it, they will. In the mean time, I would like to get rid of that banner. After clicking around I found myself on the owners team page where I can add and remove owners.</p>
<p><img src="assets/github-owners-team.jpg" title="GitHub organizations owners team" /></p>
<p>The page gives me all the controls I could ask for&#8230;except one. I can’t remove myself from the owners team! I can kick out anyone else, or add anyone else, but I can’t walk away. I have to ask someone else to kick me out, whether that’s someone else on the team or GitHub support.</p>
<p>Fortunately GitHub’s design is nice and all it takes is one little tweak:</p>
<p><img src="assets/github-owners-team-fixed.jpg" title="My tweak to GitHub’s UI" /></p>
<p>Too subtle?</p>
<p><img src="assets/github-owners-team-fixed-bam.jpg" title="In ya face" /></p>
<p>I’m not really picking on GitHub here. I imagine they will address this or have a good reason not to. I’m simply using it as one real-world example of an important interaction that many UX designers skip over.</p>
<p>Here’s one from Google Analytics. Someone else created and added me to this mystery account three years ago, and as far as I know no longer checks his email for that account.</p>
<p><img src="assets/google-analytics.jpg" title="Google Analytics account page" /></p>
<p>This case is a bit different. I can modify accounts that I’ve created, and I can view stats for an account that someone else shared with me, but I can’ t remove the account from my list.</p>
<p>Just something to keep in mind for those of you developing group functionality in your product. If someone can join or be added to a group, ensure that they have the power to leave, too.</p>
