<p>Guys walking into the privilege conversation with their Duplo blocks while the rest of us are studying subatomic particles</p>

<p>Well, yeah. Part of my privilege is being able to go through life basically unaware that bad things happen to good people solely because they're women, or brown, or muslim, or gay, or any other number of attributes that don't apply to me. I'm not completely unaware, but I certainly was for the first 25 years of my life. That's part of the privilege of being a white dude born to educated parents who worked for the United States Navy, I guess.</p>
<p>What has changed? Well to start, I dated a woman who wouldn't let me off the hook for being ignorant just because I'm mostly a good person. She made me aware of social and cultural dynamics that I never knew existed. She clued me in to issues that I have the privilege of not experiencing first-hand.</p>
<p>Second, I work in an industry that over the past few years has become more aware and vocal of the social and economic gaps between privileged groups and marginalized groups. I don't know how this awareness compares to other industries, but I do know that technologists – software technologists in particular – are uniquely suited to address disparity problems. Collectively we have a great deal of privilege that many people throughout the world do not enjoy. We can work from home, the beach, Paris, wherever we feel like. We can build successful businesses without ever stopping to put on pants. We can drop out of college and still pull down six figures. We can stretch our minds every single day, play with new concepts and ideas and never have to do the same thing twice. Most importantly, we can teach others to do all of these things.</p>
<p>Folks that enjoy privilege need to participate in this conversation. We need to start by listening. We also need to express our ideas in order to get feedback and learn. By necessity we start off simply, because we don't share the same experience and perspective. I don't expect a pat on the back for trying not to be an ignorant asshole, but I am aware that for me personally, playing with duplos represents progress. At the very least, I'm starting to put pieces together.</p>
