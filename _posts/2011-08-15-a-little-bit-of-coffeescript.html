<p>Alright so I wrote my first program in CoffeeScript. It&#8217;s my first pass at a blackjack simulator. My thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li> Syntax is quick and easy to learn, and fun to use.</li>
<li> I love the function definition syntax. Love love love.</li>
<li> Same goes for re-opening classes.</li>
<li> Scoping can be tricky when passing functions around, but it allows for a lot of power.</li>
<li> For loops are ugly</li>
<li> I need to learn how to do operator overloading</li>
<li> JavaScript is missing a lot of stuff. Need to figure out the ActiveSupport equivalent for JS.</li>
</ul>
<p>All told it only took me a couple hours to skim through the PragProg CoffeeScript book and hack this up. It went fast and I was pleased with how easily I was able to refactor the code as I built it up. Next I&#8217;m going to mess around with adding browser-side features, as well as running it in Node. And I&#8217;m going to figure out how to test it.</p>
