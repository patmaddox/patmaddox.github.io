<p><a href="https://www.google.com/#q=peyton+manning+2013+stats">Peyton Manning is having a historic season</a>, and looks poised to take my beloved Denver Broncos deep into the playoffs and hopefully bring home a Super Bowl trophy. How does he do it? It turns out that the Denver Broncos are a high-functioning agile team, and we can see how several key agile principles play out in a football context.</p>
<h3>Rapid planning, rapid execution</h3>
<p>Football teams work in short iterations in order to achieve their objective of shipping touchdowns. Each play has two parts – planning and execution. Before the play, the offense huddles up to determine which play to run. When they line up, each player understands how he's supposed to contribute to help his team move the ball closer to the end zone. Once the ball is snapped, each player performs to the best of his abilities to make that play a success. As soon as the play's done, they do it all over again. Each play looks a bit different, but follows the same cycle of planning &amp; execution.</p>
<h3>Common skills, unique talents</h3>
<p>Peyton Manning is one of the best quarterbacks to play the game, but that doesn't mean he's only good at throwing the ball. Football requires all players to practice a core set of skills – running, blocking, tackling, ball-handling, and passing. Although Peyton doesn't participate in tackling drills to the same extent as defensive players, you can bet he still practices this basic skill in case he needs to make a key tackle (<a href="http://www.arrowheadpride.com/2012/12/30/3818916/peyton-manning-tackle-brandon-flowers-chiefs-broncos">or at least help with one</a>).</p>
<h3>Communication is key</h3>
<p>When offensive plays fails, it's usually because of breakdowns in communication. A lineman misses his blocking assignment, or a receiver breaks from his route too late, or the quarterback fails to notice an oncoming blitz. Good teams communicate constantly, and nobody does it better than Peyton Manning. He has a plan before the snap, but once the teams line up he has new information. Taking in this new information and communicating with the rest of the team is key to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ3kli_EST8">adapting to the situation and making successful plays</a>.</p>
<h3>Getting up when you're knocked down</h3>
<p>Everyone gets knocked down from time to time. Cliche as it is, success comes from picking yourself up, dusting yourself off, and giving it another shot. Every team faces setbacks, whether it's a result of human error or something far beyond our control. In each case we have an opportunity to respond to the situation and learn from it. Experience, especially the bad kind, is the first step in learning.</p>
<p><em>I hope this will make the next football game you watch just a little more interesting. Where else do you see agile principles applied outside of software development?</em></p>
