<p>I just got back from the <a href="http://rubywebconf.org/">RubyWeb conference</a> in Snowbird, Utah, the birthplace of Agile - where fourteen software nerds got together and drew up the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>. <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/">Alistair Cockburn</a> gave a thought-provoking talk in which he said that to him the Agile Manifesto marked the end of something rather than a beginning. I&#8217;m still not entirely sure what that means. According to Alistair, the group wordsmithed it until every single member agreed on every single word, and it went from inception to delivery in something like six hours. That&#8217;s getting your dinner, as Alistair put it.</p>
<p>RubyWebConf is one more notch in my belt of regional conferences, and one I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to for next year. There were about 60 folks in the conference room which meant a venue intimate enough to enable heckling but not so large I felt stressed out. At events like RailsConf I spend most of my time tracking down folks I know because (a) I like to hang out with my geek friends that I rarely get to see and (b) the sea of people makes me feel awkward initiating conversations with new people. That&#8217;s why speaking at those conferences is so good - if you speak in front of a group of people and do a decent job someone is bound to approach you afterward. Solved! The small venue at RubyConf meant I was more comfortable chatting with strangers (we&#8217;re just geeks hanging around after all), and I kept running into the folks I talked to, so I could continue a conversation thread and be introduced to still other people. Long story short, smaller conferences are a lot of fun for me.</p>
<p>The following are a few thoughts I had after participating in the RubyWeb conference.</p>
<h3>Novice presenters are good for the conference</h3>
<p>I was impressed with the quality of presentations at RubyWebConf (a result of the single-track format imo). The content was great but the speakers themselves were excellent as well. I can definitely pick out the novices from the more experienced presenters, but I think the novices did a great job over all. Teaching is one of the best ways to learn, and even when I already knew the content of a talk I appreciated the effort people went through to create and deliver useful talks. Plus, as someone who&#8217;s given a few talks myself, I know how nerve-wracking it can be to speak to a crowd of intelligent, critical peers! By the way for anyone speaking at conferences, or anyone who wants to do more than sit in front of emacs/vi/whatever all day, checking out your local <a href="http://www.toastmasters.org/">Toastmasters</a> clubs is a good idea. It costs like $30 for a year and you&#8217;ll improve your spoken communication abilities like whoah.</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s okay to disengage a bit during talks</h3>
<p>Some talks I&#8217;m more interested in than others. Some may be interesting for me but too much to process at that point, or something I want to think about and explore at another time. I&#8217;m so stoked that <a href="http://twitter.com/kobier">Coby</a> at <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/">Confreaks</a> has been recording so many talks and putting them online. It&#8217;s tough to know which ones to watch, but I think he&#8217;ll be adding some features to help with that like showing # of views or integration with <a href="http://speakerrate.com/speakers/2813-pat-maddox">Speakerrate</a> or something like that. One of the reasons I go to conferences is to get an overview of what&#8217;s going on, with minimal noise. Then afterward I can look through the slides from the talk, or rewatch a video, and dig in to those topics more deeply. I&#8217;ve noticed that a lot of other people focus on the talks more and take notes in a notebook or on computer though, so to each his own. Most people do this for the first day or half day though, it&#8217;s difficult to sustain that concentration over several days. Plus with the conferences people during the workweek, we all get emails or phone calls from people requesting our attention (I support weekday conferences though - I treat conferences as an important part of my career, and I enjoy spending my weekends at home.</p>
<h3>Soft skills matter</h3>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/objo">Joe O&#8217;Brien</a> gave a great talk on communicating with customers and teammates. One of my favorite parts was how minicultures like the programming community have erected a set of beliefs and customs that bond us but that can limit the frequency and effectiveness of interactions with people outside of our culture. We should embrace our culture, but be aware of our idiosyncrasies and how they can affect our perception of other people, or their perceptions of us. I&#8217;m a bit of a communications geek you could say, but I think it was an important talk for everyone, and Joe delivers his message with a great deal of passion and insight.</p>
<p>I go to technical conferences and I want technical material. There are other aspects of our world though that we can benefit from learning, in particular for people who want to build businesses. Frankly I think that I and a lot of the people I know are too smart to not only make money while we&#8217;re working, and technical chops alone won&#8217;t earn us money while we sleep. One soft skill per day, delivered by an advanced speaker, is the sweet spot as far as I&#8217;m concerned.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got for now. Big ups to <a href="http://twitter.com/blowmage">Mike Moore</a> and the rest of the RubyWeb conference crew (whoever they are - it couldn&#8217;t have been Mike alone, could it?!). They put on a killer conference. Connectivity was great too, a conference first for me!</p>
