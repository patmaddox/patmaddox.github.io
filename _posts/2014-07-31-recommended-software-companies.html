<h1>Software development companies that I recommend hiring or working at</h1>
<p>People often ask if I can recommend companies to work on large software<br />
projects. Just as often, people ask me if I can suggest companies they should<br />
apply to work at. I've always listed a few solid recommendations, and then a<br />
couple others that I think might be good based on people I know that work there<br />
or have worked there.</p>
<p>I'm changing my policy as of today. I'm only going to give the solid<br />
recommendations - the recommendations I can give based on my personal<br />
experience. With that in mind, if you are looking to hire a company to work on<br />
your software project, or you are looking for a place to bring your talents, I<br />
suggest contacting:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://pivotallabs.com">Pivotal Labs</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thunderboltlabs.com">Thunderbolt Labs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The answer is the same for both questions - who to hire, and where to work -<br />
because a place that does the best work is where the best people want to work -<br />
and they do.</p>
<p>I have worked for a client of Pivotal Labs, and worked for Pivotal as a<br />
contractor. They have perfected the art of constructing effective software. They<br />
also have created a work environment that I think is just killer - smart and<br />
friendly coworkers, a commitment to best practices, predictable SANE hours,<br />
regular learning opportunities, and oh yeah the amazing breakfast every morning.</p>
<p>I've known the brains behind Thunderbolt Labs for several years. They take a<br />
scientific approach to software development, and cut through way more bullshit<br />
than you're prepared to throw at them. As far as work environment, they work<br />
mostly remotely and have the smartest people I've ever seen on one team. Working<br />
for Thunderbolt got my fingers in two of the biggest software projects to happen<br />
in 2013 in my opinion, in terms of visibility and coolness. Perhaps they'll give<br />
me permission to reveal the clients' names... :)</p>
<h2 id="therest">The rest</h2>
<p>I'm sure there are a lot of wonderful companies out there that will do a great<br />
job of building your software, or be a great place for you to grow as a<br />
developer. At this point, I can only honestly recommend places that I have<br />
direct experience with - and I have lots of direct experience with Pivotal and<br />
Thunderbolt Labs.</p>
<p>HOWEVER if you think your company should be on this list, we can absolutely make<br />
it happen. All we need to do is arrange for me to spend 2+ days working with<br />
your team in an ordinary work environment (other than the fact that there's an<br />
outside observer who's apparently doing reviews on his blog?). You don't pay me,<br />
you just cover my travel and accomodations. If I choose not to recommend you, I<br />
won't ever say anything about my visit. If I do recommend you though, you will<br />
join the list of what are - in my opinion at least - elite software development<br />
companies.</p>
