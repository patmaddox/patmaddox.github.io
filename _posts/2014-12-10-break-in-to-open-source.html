<p>&quot;So... got anything on GitHub?&quot;</p>
<p>Some developers light up when you ask them that. They start gushing about their latest project and all the things they've learned, and how they can't wait to try out the ideas they had in the two minutes since you started the conversation.</p>
<p>Does that sound like you? Or do you feel the blood rush to your face as you shuffle your feet and admit, &quot;well yeah, but I haven't really worked on anything in a while...&quot; or even a flat-out &quot;no&quot; which is met with an even flatter &quot;oh&quot;.</p>
<p>What if you could change the conversation from &quot;Got anything on GitHub&quot; to &quot;We saw your work on GitHub and really liked it... are you looking for any new opportunities?&quot;</p>
<p>If you're already coding on a regular basis, you can do exactly that. All you have to do is...</p>
<ol>
<li>Push your stuff to GitHub</li>
<li>Wait</li>
</ol>
<p>It really is that simple. Of course, you have to repeat it over and over again. You might not get any interest in your first dozen or so projects, but you will establish a pattern of creating and sharing software you find useful, and that's what really makes employers eager to talk to you.</p>
<p>Still here? Shame on you! :) Go push something to GitHub. Then do it again tomorrow.</p>
