<p>Alex Bunardzic tells us that <a href="http://jooto.com/blog/index.php/2006/12/25/contracts-and-coupling-in-resource-oriented-architecture/">the web is not based on contracts</a>, but on &#8220;extremely pronounced and unbendable bias.&#8221;  I believe he hesitates to call them rules, at least initially, because breaking the rules generally leads to negative consequences.  Fighting the bias, on the other hand, is more like a salmon swimming upstream, just without the biological imperative.  Nothing bad is going to happen, but you don&#8217;t get any benefit either.</p>
<p>The bias of the web is simple: you can locate a resource, and a resource knows how to represent itself and alter its own state.  That&#8217;s really all there is to it.  The incredibly huge implication of this bias is that anything that does not define location or representation/state transition is uninteresting and even unimportant.  URIs serve as the locator mechanism, and HTTP as the mechanism for representation and state transfer, so everything else is just infrastructure that should be hidden and can be changed at will.</p>
<p>This very simple bias is what makes the web uncoupled, as opposed to extremely loosely coupled.  A client can locate a resource with a URI, and then communicate with that resource using HTTP.  A server just serves up resources.  The beautiful thing is that neither knows the other exists - they each only deal with resources.  Don&#8217;t get caught up in the technical details of moving bits across the network.  You need to understand that web clients only deal with one abstraction - resources - and web servers only deal with one abstraction&#8230;resources.</p>
<p>The traffic analogy perfectly illustrates the web&#8217;s bias.  There are one or two completely non-negotiable rules which lead to a highly efficient, simple system.  If you choose not to follow the rules, nothing bad really happens, you just miss out on the huge benefits of the system.  More interesting though is what happens when a critical mass of people choose not to follow the rules: complete and utter chaos.  Imagine what would happen if 10% of American drivers decide they&#8217;re going to drive on the left side of the road.  It would completely destroy the effective system we have in place.  A single rogue driver wouldn&#8217;t have any appreciable effect, but the system becomes worthless as soon as we have more than simply isolated incidents.</p>
<p>One recent popular saying is that &#8220;constraints are liberating.&#8221;  A few simple, completely rigid constraints are supremely liberating by providing you with a solid framework within which to work.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to recognize the value of a simple system that works.  It&#8217;s even more important to recognize the potential dangers in fighting the rules of that system.  In the web&#8217;s case, following the simple rules leads to easy, effective communication.  Fighting them leads to chaos.</p>
<p>With that in mind, what are the implications of REST vs those of WS-*?</p>
