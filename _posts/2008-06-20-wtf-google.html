<p>Every once in a while I like to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?ie=utf8&amp;oe=utf8&amp;q=pat+maddox">google</a></p>
<p>myself</p>

<p>But if you click through, you&#8217;ll see that my REAL quote is</p></p>

<p>into an open source project, it&#8217;s probably a good idea to share good</p>
<p>will with them when something very joyous occurs in their live. The</p>
<p>author isn&#8217;t criticizing Stallman&#8217;s intellectual argument, just saying</p>
