<p>I&#8217;m speaking at the <a href="http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/ruby2008/">Voices that Matter conference</a> in Boston from November 17-20.  To tell you the truth, I&#8217;m not too keen on the name, but Obie already <a href="http://blog.obiefernandez.com/content/2008/09/voices-that-matter-professional-ruby-conference.html">cleared that up</a>.  There are some <a href="http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/ruby2008/schedule.aspx">great speakers</a> lined up.  I won&#8217;t tell you about them since we already know they matter.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m speaking twice&#8230;first at 9am on Monday (urgh) I&#8217;ll be giving a workshop on BDD with RSpec.  It&#8217;s going to be pretty awesome, don&#8217;t miss it.</p>
<h2>Ask me anything about testing</h2>
<p>Then again Tuesday night I&#8217;ll be on a testing panel with <a href="http://smartic.us/">Bryan Liles</a> and others.  We&#8217;ll argue a lot.  I wouldn&#8217;t miss this one either.  Obie has set up a <a href="http://moderator.appspot.com/#e%253Dagltb2RlcmF0b3JyDQsSBlNlcmllcxjPBQw%252Bt%253Dagltb2RlcmF0b3JyDAsSBVRvcGljGI0EDA%252Bv%253D0%252Bs%253D1">google moderator thing</a> where we&#8217;ll be collecting the questions.  Please check it out and add any questions you&#8217;ve got.  Even if you&#8217;re not going, you should add some questions, because you&#8217;ll get the answers on video or on this blog.  And it&#8217;s just helpful to the community as a whole</p>
<h2>SAVE MONEHS</h2>
<p>If you <a href="http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/ruby2008/pricing.aspx">register</a> with code <b>PRDPKRL</b> then you get $200 off!!  Be sure to <b>register by October 6th</b> to save another 200 bucks. (yikes, I didn&#8217;t give you much time)</p>
<h2>Breakfast with the speakers</h2>
<p>Thursday morning, some of the speakers will sit at big round tables and talk about whatever comes to mind.  I&#8217;ll be there, so I&#8217;d love to meet you and chat over a nice breakfast.</p>
