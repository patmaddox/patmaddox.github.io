<p>From an anonymous comment on <a href="http://kickin-the-darkness.blogspot.com/2007/09/confessions-of-terrible-programmer.html">Confessions of a Terrible Programmer</a></p>
<div class="quote"><q>The greatest programmer I met was a kid with a degree in Maths. He was legendary for the least fix-failed and knock-on bugs. One day I sat next to him as we went through a bug I found in his code. He fixed it quickly (it was a minor error) but spent 15 minutes going through _every_ code path he had changed. Line-by-line in the debugger inspecting each variable in scope verifying everything. I was amazed - he was not actually more talented than me, he was more rigorous. Second was a bloke who put a break point after each open { in the code he wrote. Whenever a break-point was hit the first time he stepped through the code verifying it. If a breakpoint was going stale (had sat un-hit for a long amount of time) he examined the code to find out why. I haven&#8217;t yet learned such rigor as these two - but they stand in my mind as pinnacles of our art.</q></div>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;d rather write specs.</p>
