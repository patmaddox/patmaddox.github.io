<p><em>Uh-oh, it looks like I&#8217;m getting into politics.  One of my <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/">favorite bloggers</a> says, &#8220;Anybody can say you can&#8217;t write. Let no one say you don&#8217;t.&#8221;  I&#8217;m gonna run with that</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always thought it was pretty silly when people get outraged and claim that their rights are being trampled when a company censors them in some fashion.  I would hope it&#8217;s very clear to people that the Constitution protects us from governmental abuse and has nothing to do with private companies.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/27/us/27verizon.html">Verizon is censoring some of the traffic that goes over their network</a>.  An abortion rights group started a text message campaign to inform interested parties about their pro-choice agenda.  Apparently the other major networks are allowing the program, but Verizon is blocking it because it&#8217;s &#8220;controversial or unsavory.&#8221;</p>
<p>If a company censors me in some way, they&#8217;re not violating my rights in a legal sense.  I would say that they&#8217;re violating my rights in an ethical sense though.  That doesn&#8217;t make them a criminal company, it just makes them a crappy company.  I don&#8217;t like to do business with crappy companies, so I simply wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I think that normally that ought to be the end of the issue.  Companies can censor customers if they want, and customers can choose not to do business with those companies if they don&#8217;t like their practices.  Let the market decide what level of openness companies need to provide.  Personally I hope that consumers would flat out reject any company that tries to restrict what its customers can do.</p>
<p>There is another critical element to this issue though, and that&#8217;s that Verizon is a communications company.  Customers pay them to be able to communicate with other people, and that&#8217;s the bottom line.  If Verizon restricts how people can communicate, then I believe they&#8217;re no longer providing the service they&#8217;re supposed to thus customers should be released from their contracts.  In this case, I don&#8217;t think the government should order Verizon to allow the communication, but instead should recognize that Verizon breached the service agreement and should let customers leave if they choose to.  In effect it&#8217;s the same thing as making Verizon allow the communication, but I think the difference is an important one.  It makes it clear that the issue is not one of private companies violating Constitutional rights, but rather holds companies accountable to provide some level of service and not fuck over their customers.</p>
<p>If I stop paying my cell phone bill, my provider shuts off my service.  On the flip side, if my provider stops or restricts my service, then I shouldn&#8217;t have to pay my bill at all.  Unfortunately we&#8217;re stuck with this ridiculous model where people get locked in to a certain company for 2+ years at a time, and it&#8217;s scary for the consumer to take the provider head-on.  It sure looks like we&#8217;re moving away from that model towards something more normal (can you imagine signing a 2 year agreement with the electric company?  uh&#8230;).  Hopefully we&#8217;ll find that companies are forced to increase their level of service in order to retain customers instead of locking them into restrictive contracts while providing crippled services.</p>
<p>This article would still be newsworthy if there were no contracts, but it would be a good deal less interesting.  In essence it would be simply, &#8220;Verizon restricts customer communications, customers flee in droves.&#8221; I think the real issue at hand is the broken model of locking people in to contracts.  Yes I understand that communications companies make significant hardware and infrastructure investments that they need to recoup.  Hold on to your customers by providing an excellent service.  If you provide a crappy service then you deserve to go out of business.</p>

<p>Not coincidentally (see my comment about crappy companies above) I ran away from Verizon the second my contract was up.  In fact I was looking forward to that for months.</p>
