<p>What is it with all of the presentations and blog posts titled &#8220;X sucks&#8221;?  Don&#8217;t pretend that you created a content-rich presentation but slapped on a provocative title just for effect.  If your goal is to immediately bias the listeners toward your position, job well done.  But I guarantee you that it does nothing to add to intelligent discussion in the software development community.</p>
<p>My biggest problem with &#8220;X sucks&#8221; talks is that they are so fucking insulting to my intelligence.  News flash: any tool or technique sucks when used incorrectly or in the wrong context.  And presenting only one side of an argument is the surest sign that you either don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about, or that you&#8217;re a self-indulgent asshole.  You know who else only presents one side of an argument, and discredits other opinions through hand-waving and strawmen?  Politicians and lawyers.  Congrats on joining such esteemed company!</p>
<p>When you stand up to present to your local user&#8217;s group, you have a responsibility to give them the highest quality information you can.  This can be in the form of hard data, or experience, or references to other people&#8217;s work, and the ideal presentation will use a combination of these.  Do your best to explain and argue your position, but make sure that you make people aware that there is another side to the debate, one that you aren&#8217;t presenting, that they should go search for themselves if they&#8217;re interested.  I have yet to come across a software-related topic that can be fully explored in a one-hour presentation.  Don&#8217;t insult your audience&#8217;s intelligence by presenting an extremist stance.  At best they&#8217;ll think you&#8217;re an idiot.  At worst you&#8217;ll fuel the FUD machine that has been plowing through the software industry all these years.</p>
<p>An interesting point about &#8220;X sucks&#8221; is that 6 months later, you will probably find out that you&#8217;re wrong!  I find that desirable, as it demonstrates maturation as a developer and as a person.  In that sense, &#8220;X sucks&#8221; might not be such a bad thing as it represents one step on your path to enlightenment.  Just be sure to <strong>heavily</strong> qualify your talk as presenting your personal experience at this moment in time, and that there are plenty of people who disagree with you, and that a few months from now you may completely reverse your position.  Realistically, you will probably bounce from one extreme to another, with the extremes gradually moving towards each other like the peaks of a fading sine wave, until you reach an equilibrium point.  This equilibrium point is that fine line between &#8220;X sucks&#8221; and &#8220;X rocks,&#8221; where at any given moment you can only know which side you&#8217;re on based on tons of experience.</p>
<p>The next time you sit down to write an &#8220;X sucks&#8221; blog post or talk, please reconsider.  Honor your abilities as a thinking developer by taking the time to advance our industry&#8217;s dialogue rather than making yourself look clever by trashing other people or techniques.  We&#8217;ll all be better for it.</p>
