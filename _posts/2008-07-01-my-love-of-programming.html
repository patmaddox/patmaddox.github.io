<p>If you read my blog, you&#8217;ve <a></p>
<p>href=&#8221;http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2008/06/how-i-got-started-programming.html&#8221;&gt;already</p>
<p></a></p>
<p><a></p>
<p>href=&#8221;http://www.slash7.com/articles/2008/6/30/how-i-got-started-programming&#8221;&gt;seen</p>
<p></a></p>
<p>the <a></p>
<p>href=&#8221;http://onestepback.org/index.cgi/Tech/Programming/SoftwareDevelSteps.red&#8221;&gt;meme</p>
<p></a>.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll just dive right into it:</p>
<h1>How old were you when you started programming?</h1></p>
<p>I wrote my first program in second grade.  My school had a lab of</p>
<p>Apple IIGSes, and the coolest teacher in the world, Mrs. Fletcher.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fletcher was this sparkplug of a woman with neatly kept hair that</p>
<p>constantly escaped to zany freedom.  I think for the first week we</p>
<p>learned to draw or something.  The second week, though, we learned to</p>
<p>make the turtle draw.  By the way, when I say &#8220;first week&#8221; and &#8220;second</p>
<p>week,&#8221; I really mean &#8220;the smaller period of time at the beginning of</p>
<p>the year&#8221; and &#8220;the larger period of time at the end of the year,&#8221;</p>
<p>because in second grade I had no concept of time.</p></p>
<p>So here I am in the U-shaped computer lab directing a 5x5px turtle to</p>
<p>draw pictures of tanks and helicopters.  Not real programming, but</p>
<p>that was the start.  Mrs. Fletcher saw that I really liked</p>
<p>programming, and usually left me to my own devices to play with Logo</p>
<p>while the other kids had to follow her mostly-scripted lesson.</p></p>
<p>The next big step came when my teacher told my mom how interested I</p>
<p>was in computers.  She explained that I wasn&#8217;t the typical kid who</p>
<p>liked to play computer games, but rather I took an interest in the</p>
<p>deeper, interesting &#8220;productive&#8221; aspects of computers.  My mom,</p>
<p>totally kick-ass mother that she is, got me an oversized magazine</p>
<p>called (I think) &#8220;BASIC Programming for Kids.&#8221;  I think it showed how</p>
<p>to start up QBasic and stuff, and had pages and pages of program</p>
<p>listings that I could type in to my computer at home.  I don&#8217;t</p>
<p>remember it having any info on how to actually program, and if there</p>
<p>was then I never read it.</p></p>
<p>Being a pre-novice user, I had no idea I could save files.  I used to</p>
<p>type 12 page-long programs into QBasic, repeating the exercise</p>
<p>nightly, due to the household mandate that the computer be turned off</p>
<p>before bedtime.  You could say that I really dug <a></p>
<p>href=&#8221;http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/code_kata_backg.html&#8221;&gt;Code</p>
<p>Kata</p>
<p></a>.</p></p>
<p>I never used the programs I wrote much.  As soon as I had figured out</p>
<p>the slew of syntax errors I made (long before I knew what a syntax</p>
<p>error was, of course) and gotten the program to run again, I would</p>
<p>immediately stop running it so I could make it do something different.</p>
<p>My favorite program was a blackjack game.  My ultimate achievement was</p>
<p>prompting for the player&#8217;s name when the game started, and to deal</p>
<p>myself blackack every time and to deal everyone else random hands..</p>
<p>My mom thought it was great and encouraged my new hobby.  Little did</p>
<p>she know that 10 years later, my interest in computers and gambling</p>
<p>would lead to me take an &#8220;extended&#8221; leave of absence from a $30k/yr</p>
<p>school that she was working hard to help pay for.  More on that later.</p>
<h1>How did you get started in programming?</h1></p>
<p>We now know how old I was when I wrote my first program.  I</p>
<p>didn&#8217;t <em>really</em> get started util 6th grade.  This time it was a cool</p>
<p>Ex-pat teacher named Mr Bowyer.  He introduced me to Java, after I had</p>
<p>told him that I really liked programming.  Java was brand new or</p>
<p>something and was the future because you could put interactive shit on</p>
<p>webpages.  It wasn&#8217;t that interesting to me.  So when I went to the</p>
<p>bookstore with my mom to find a Java book, we came across one that was</p>
<p>about web programming in general.  It showed you how to do stuff with</p>
<p>Java, C, Perl, and maybe some other things.  I really liked the</p>
<p>spidering engine written in Perl.  I was determined to write a spider</p>
<p>that would crawl every single page on the internet.  Ah, if only my</p>
<p>mom didn&#8217;t make me turn off the computer at night, I&#8217;d have been king</p>
<p>of the internet and Larry and Sergey would have finished their PhDs</p>
<p>and lived in obscurity.</p>
<h1>What was your first language?</h1>
<p>Logo, I suppose.</p></p>
<p>The first programming language I ever tried to learn was C++.  I had</p>
<p>that web programming book, and I deduced that Java was boring and C</p>
<p>was too old.  C++ was smack dab in the sweet spot of</p>
<p>learn-worthiness.  12-year old logic rocks.</p>
<h1>What was the first real program you wrote?</h1></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if the others are answering this as &#8220;what&#8217;s the first</p>
<p>serious program you wrote.&#8221;  I&#8217;m going to answer it as &#8220;what&#8217;s the</p>
<p>first program that you wrote without copying from a book.&#8221;</p></p>
<p>I had this obsession with writing programs that did things until</p>
<p>infinite.  I already mentioned the web spider.  Once I reached a point</p>
<p>where I could think logically, I wrote programs that counted to</p>
<p>infinite, found powers to infinite, calculated pi to infinite decimal</p>
<p>places, etc.</p>
<p>This is the first program I ever wrote:</p>
<p><script src="http://gist.github.com/495356.js?file=gistfile1.cpp"></script></p>
<p>The funny thing is that that it segfaults my MacBook pro, but it did</p>
<p>really count forever on my machine back then.  Not to infinite though</p>
<p>of course.  My mom let me leave it on overnight one night, but I never</p>
<p>saw what happened.  Windows 95 always closed the shell window</p>
<p>immediately when I terminated the program, so I could only see the blur of</p>
<p>numbers going by.</p>
<h1>What languages have you used since you started programming?</h1></p>
<p>I toyed with a bunch of different languages growing up.  My mom made</p>
<p>me an agreement that she would buy me a computer book, and then when I</p>
<p>finished it she would get me another one.  Her idea was that I was a</p>
<p>12 year-old, these are 500-page dry technical books, it won&#8217;t last.</p>
<p>As it turned out, I tore through these books in under a month and</p>
<p>sometimes even a week (of actual time, not little kid time).  Computer</p>
<p>books being $50 a pop, my mom soon discontinued her offer and signed</p>
<p>me up for a library card instead.</p></p>
<p>My mom really supported my brother&#8217;s and my activities growing up.  We</p>
<p>weren&#8217;t rich by any means, but she was willing to put a little bit of</p>
<p>money and a lot of energy into feeding our creative and intellectual</p>
<p>appetites.  Both of our parents were great, actually.  My dad used to</p>
<p>make balsa wood airplanes with my brother, though a big part of it was</p>
<p>just that he liked balsa wood airplanes - he didn&#8217;t &#8220;get&#8221; the</p>
<p>programming thing until much later (old fart doesn&#8217;t get computers</p>
<p>at all! :)</p></p>
<p>These days, people pay me to write programs, and my little brother is</p>
<p>beginning his first job at a regional airline.  Go figure, noticing</p>
<p>your kids&#8217; interests and then supporting the constructive ones goes a</p>
<p>long way.</p></p>
<p>Oh, wait.  The question was what languages I&#8217;ve used.  Logo, BASIC,</p>
<p>C++, C, Java, Perl, PHP.  Those are when I was younger.  More recently</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used some for business and pleasure (Ruby &amp; Javascript), some to</p>
<p>explore programming (Scheme, Smalltalk), some to tinker and make life</p>
<p>better (Emacs Lisp), and some to get over my intense fear of static</p>
<p>typing (Haskell &amp; Scala).</p>
<h1>What was your first professional programming gig?</h1></p>
<p>Earlier I alluded to dropping out of school for computers and</p>
<p>gambling.  Actually, I dropped out for other reasons, and I happened</p>
<p>to gravitate to computers and gambling.</p>
<p>I dropped out of school for three main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rochester, NY is fucking cold and miserable</li>
<li>College without liberal arts or girls is not exactly educating me
<p>well for life</p>
</li>
<li>Building UML diagrams in Rational Rose and then generating
<p>skeleton code from them is a crappy way to program</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>College for me was a few fun-but-painful-as-in-hungover-not-emotional</p>
<p>memories of hanging out with smart, cool people who didn&#8217;t take life</p>
<p>too seriously.  Unfortunately, the rest of the time was being</p>
<p>depressed about the weather, the boxes of never-to-be-used condoms my</p>
<p>mom sent me in care packages, and the fact that programming outside of</p>
<p>my door room was tedious and structured and just generally</p>
<p>spirit-killing.</p></p>
<p>Quick travel through time:  I spent the next year and a half playing</p>
<p>poker in Bremerton and Seattle cardrooms.  At some point I started to</p>
<p>play online.  It was less fun, but I made more money.</p></p>
<p>I decided to move back home to Colorado, now that I could make money</p>
<p>playing online, instead of having to play in physical cardrooms.  It</p>
<p>wasn&#8217;t long before I got bored, however, so I did some contract work</p>
<p>for a local web shop.  The owner, Jim, was cool, and I met one of my</p>
<p>best friends doing it, but it was PHP and painful so I emailed Jim my</p>
<p>resignation at 2am one night I happened to win $200.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re thinking I&#8217;m an irresponsible jackass at this point, well, yeah.</p></p>
<p>I started to play single-table tournaments, and I played multiple</p>
<p>games at a time.  I learned that while most poker involves skills at</p>
<p>reading people, tournament end-games were largely mathematical.  There</p>
<p>was a piece of software that would let you analyze hands and calculate</p>
<p>the precise amount of money you would win or lose depending on which</p>
<p>action you choose.  It&#8217;s not really math that people can do in their</p>
<p>heads, what you&#8217;re really learning is situational awareness.  I</p>
<p>decided to flip it around and write a &#8220;flash card&#8221; program - it would</p>
<p>generate scenarios, prompt me for an action, then calculate the</p>
<p>results of my action.  It was a way to get a lot of experience</p>
<p>rapidly, and provided hook points to analyze poker problems even</p>
<p>further.</p></p>
<p>My friend saw this program and told me that I should turn it into a</p>
<p>web app and sell subscriptions.  That was my first real Rails app, and</p>
<p>my customers paid me enough that I could maintain it a little bit and</p>
<p>get drunk with my friends a lot (it was paying the rent, too - at</p>
<p>least I was out of my mom&#8217;s house by this point!).  I felt really cool</p>
<p>because rails was just starting up and 37signals was all like &#8220;you can</p>
<p>build products on the web!&#8221; and I had built a product that people paid</p>
<p>for, as my first commercial site.</p>
<h1>If there is one thing you learned along the way that you would tell new developers, what would it be?</h1></p>
<p>If you got into programming because you love doing it, then the most</p>
<p>important thing is to be mindful of those aspects of programming that</p>
<p>align with what you love.  For me, the joy in programming comes from</p>
<p>ego and problem-solving.  I was hooked on programming as an 8 year-old</p>
<p>because there was something in the world that I could control.  I</p>
<p>lived an active little boy life, but when I made decisions that</p>
<p>conflicted with what adults wanted, I was always &#8220;wrong.&#8221;  And here&#8217;s</p>
<p>the computer, a fancy expensive adult thing, that would *bend to my</p>
<p>will.*  I also learned a little bit about responsibility - if the</p>
<p>computer didn&#8217;t do what I want, I couldn&#8217;t get angry or frustrated,</p>
<p>because it was just doing what I told it to.  I had to take</p>
<p>responsibility for my emotions, and to choose to move ahead and solve</p>
<p>the problem at hand.</p></p>
<p>Besides ego, problem-solving is the biggest motivator for me.  And</p>
<p>problem-solving to me isn&#8217;t necessarily completing a problem, but</p>
<p>rather reaching a point where I know the solution.  I&#8217;m sure this is</p>
<p>why there are a lot of programmers just like me, who have dozens or</p>
<p>hundreds of half-baked projects sitting in their <em>work/</em> dir.  We only</p>
<p>manage to finish the ones that solve painful real-life problems.  The</p>
<p>rest of them are cool ideas that get broken down into tiny</p>
<p>subproblems, and are discarded when the interesting subproblems have</p>
<p>been solved.</p></p>
<p>This is why I&#8217;d caution you to not take my home girl Amy Hoy&#8217;s words</p>
<p>too literally.  You can say that programming is a means to an end, but</p>
<p>I think the journey is filled with endless nuggets that make you</p>
<p>happy.  To be perfectly honest, I don&#8217;t see anything wrong with</p>
<p>arguing about syntax.  I&#8217;m all for discussing the minutiae and</p>
<p>developing individual taste.  It&#8217;s like anything else you might talk</p>
<p>about, important or trivial - you can probably have fun and/or learn a</p>
<p>lot, just don&#8217;t be an asshole.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that Amy would agree with some of that.</p></p>
<p>One key thing about being aware of your love of programming is to be</p>
<p>around other people who have that same passion and are doing cool</p>
<p>stuff.  Friends of mine are building <a></p>
<p>href=&#8221;http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2008/06/archaeopteryx-first-ever-artificial.html&#8221;&gt;AI</p>
<p>musicians</p>
<p></a>, writing <a></p>
<p>href=&#8221;http://github.com/nkallen/arel/tree/master&#8221;&gt;Rack for</p>
<p>databases</p>
<p></a>, and creating the <a></p>
<p>href=&#8221;http://treetop.rubyforge.org/&#8221;&gt;basis</p>
<p></a> of a Ruby text editor</p>
<p>(think emacs in Ruby - SICK).  These kinds of people love to talk</p>
<p>about programming, and most of all illuminate creative areas that I</p>
<p>never knew existed.</p></p>
<p>If you got into programming for some reason other than you love doing</p>
<p>it - I dunno.</p>
<h1>What&#8217;s the most fun you&#8217;ve ever had &#8230; programming?</h1></p>
<p>Something recent was a combination of my ego and problem-solving</p>
<p>interests.  I was talking with a friend about how to assign behavior</p>
<p>to arbitrary objects in predefined contexts.  I decided it would be</p>
<p>easy to pop the existing methods off the object and store them away,</p>
<p>undefine the methods making it a blank slate, and point all calls to a new</p>
<p>object which had the stored methods bound to it.  This had a </p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>practical problem</em> - adding and removing discrete units of</p>
<p>behavior without modifying the object&#8217;s behavior</p>
</li>
<li>
<em>interesting subproblems</em> - unbinding methods and rebinding them to</p>
<p>other objects; reconstructing an inheritance heirarchy</p>
</li>
<li>
<em>ego trip</em> - what kind of fucked up stuff can I do to Ruby?  I had</p>
<p>to take a trip into the C source to remove checks for</p>
<p>class-equality that were probably important but were in my way so</p>
<p>they had to go</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My favorite program ever was something I wrote in tenth grade.  I had</p>
<p>been dating the cute, smart soccer chick for a month.  In high school,</p>
<p>a month is a big deal.  To some people anyway.  I don&#8217;t think my</p>
<p>girlfriend cared, but remember I was dating the cute, smart soccer</p>
<p>chick so I was counting my lucky stars.  I wrote a program that</p>
<p>prompted her for her name, and when she entered hers it said &#8220;Happy</p>
<p>month anniversary, Christine.&#8221;  If you typed something else it just</p>
<p>beeped at you.  Fortunately she dug it, or dug me and just pretended</p>
<p>to dig it, so even at 15 or so lines of code it packed a lot of punch.</p></p>
<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time building my emacs.  God damn,</p>
<p>emacs is like crack to a tinkerer who spends most of his waking life</p>
<p>coding and working with text.</p></p>
<p>And of course, I love working with <a></p>
<p>href=&#8221;http://rspec.info/&#8221;&gt;RSpec</p>
<p></a></p>
<h1>The others</h1></p>
<p>So I realize I wrote this huge thing that really nobody would have</p>
<p>much interest in reading.  I&#8217;m going to give the link to my mom though</p>
<p>because she has to love me and will enjoy it.</p></p>
<p>While she&#8217;s reading, I invite some of my friends and other interesting</p>
<p>people to share their stories:</p>
