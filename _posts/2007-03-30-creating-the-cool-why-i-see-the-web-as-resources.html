<p>Drunk girl at bar: &#8220;So what do you do for a living?&#8221;</p>
<p>Even drunker Pat: &#8220;I&#8217;m a programmer&#8221;</p>
<p>DG: &#8220;What kind of programmer?&#8221;</p>
<p>EDP: &#8220;I build web applications&#8221;</p>
<p>DG: &#8220;What&#8217;s web applications?&#8221;</p>
<p>EDP: &#8220;This is boring, wanna fuck?&#8221;</p>
<p>*smack*</p>
<p>True story.  Some much, much weirder stuff happened last weekend though, believe me.  Anyway.</p>
<p>A few people witnessed the slap, word got around, and pretty much every girl there thought I was an asshole.  So I had plenty of time alone to explore my drunken ideas on just what *is* a web application?</p>
<p>To get it out of the way, <a>Web application or webapp is an application that is accessed with a Web browser over a network such as the Internet or an intranet.</a>  Booooring. We&#8217;ll go with my drunken ideas instead.</p>
<p>I view the web as a <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000593.html">world of resources</a>.</p>
<p>I view the web as a world of resources because people are smart.  Okay actually people are stupid, but they&#8217;re still smarter than computers.  I know this because I could build a simple web app that has two forms, one where you enter expenses, and one where you enter income.  If I stick this in front of a conscious person, they can start entering stuff and build a simple ledger.  If I give it to a computer, nothing happens.</p>
<p>So tonight I&#8217;ve begun to define, in my mind, what constitutes intelligence - the ability to take simple resources and construct or do something useful.</p>
<p>Humans can do that, computers can&#8217;t.  The only way a computer can do something useful is if a human tells it to, so obviously it&#8217;s still human intelligence driving the process.</p>
<p>Because computers are stupid, we can only tell them to do so much.  I might build some application that makes decisions and does something useful, but of course it&#8217;s still constrained to whatever scenarios I imagined when I wrote it.  This is nothing new, there&#8217;s plenty of info on artificial intelligence to keep you busy for a long time.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s new, or rather perhaps just not pervasive in the web community, is using that concept as the basis for building web applications.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">SOA</a> is a common goal these days, but it&#8217;s fundamentally flawed - a computer &#8220;doing&#8221; something can&#8217;t be nearly as valuable or interesting as a person doing something.  It&#8217;s relatively static, it won&#8217;t approach anything that a person with a modicum of intelligence and sufficient resources could create.</p>
<p>(Yes I would ask a computer to calculate 123^456 for me.  That&#8217;s not intelligence though - I could get the correct answer if you gave me enough time)</p>
<p>If services suck, then what&#8217;s a better way?  You&#8217;re probably smart enough to guess that I&#8217;m suggesting a <a href="http://jooto.com/blog/index.php/2006/08/08/replacing-service-oriented-architecture-with-resource-oriented-architecture/">resource-oriented architecture</a>.  It&#8217;s really, really simple.  We give people resources, we do all the work of storing and managing those resources, and let people produce valuable stuff.  There&#8217;s nothing else to it.  Resources that have the potential to be useful combined with basic human intelligence will result in much more value than whatever service a computer can provide.</p>
<p>When people criticize REST, or ask what benefit it provides, I can honestly say &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;  I don&#8217;t know because who can truly know what kind of stuff people will do?  The main benefit of a ROA is that you don&#8217;t know what will happen&#8230;you just give people the resources to do something and then let them run with it.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s why I see the web as a bunch of resources, and why I think we should code our apps that way.  It&#8217;s the only way to empower users, which so much software claims to do, because users need stuff in order to do other stuff.  Computers just get in the way, because they&#8217;re not smart enough not to.</p>
<p>Now we&#8217;ll go back to the original question of what makes an application.  I think a web app is a pretty loose term, and it&#8217;s best thought of as a kind of guide book.  When you get a travel book for Italy, it&#8217;ll tell you all these great places, suggest trips to take, but ultimately it&#8217;s up to you to have a good time.  In the same way, a web app is just a bunch of resources, and the connections between them are ideas on how they could be used.  We can suggest uses for and interactions between resources, but it&#8217;s up to the user to actually do something useful with them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still wrapping my head around this.  The basic idea though is that instead of trying to do too much, I can just give people basic resources that have the potential for cool, and let people create even more cool out of them.</p>
