<p>You don&#39;t always have to have a plan for your projects. You can just hack away, and revisit things whenever you like. If you get a group of friends together, the project just might grow legs of its own...</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/RubySteps/mob_rotation">RubySteps mob_rotation</a> tool began life as 40 lines of code. A few months later, it has <a href="https://github.com/RubySteps/mob_rotation/blob/master/Contributors.md">33 listed contributors</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/RubySteps/mob_rotation/graphs/contributors">22 with credit on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>In the first session, we really didn&#39;t know what we were doing. We knew we wanted to program together, and we know we could do it online. We had a vague idea of something to build - a tool to manage our mob rotation as we worked - but no solid idea of where to begin.</p>
<p>At the end of that session, we had produced the <a href="https://github.com/RubySteps/mob_rotation/commit/4f0574ba77541292e4bb2e483b8824cc2b766db5">40 lines of code in our first commit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/RubySteps/mob_rotation/commit/877ea2286cbc64423606599e0b303a776d379b6d">refactored</a> and added <a href="https://github.com/RubySteps/mob_rotation/commit/4ebc6760a600d95d309ce02232958c0f915ae29b">unit tests</a>. It doesn&#39;t look like much, and it&#39;s not. The code doesn&#39;t matter very much - it&#39;s an artifact of a shared programming experience.</p>
<p>We enjoyed that shared programming experience... and continued to meet to explore the idea together. Over time, it&#39;s grown in to the delightful little project you see today - more mature documentation, tests, involvement from outside the original coding teams, and team members managing issues and pull requests.</p>
<p>We never set specific goals for things to work on. Each team member had their own ideas for what to do, and we played games to help make sure everyone had a chance to contribute. I&#39;ll share more info on those games in later posts.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology#Guiding_principles_and_one_law">Our main game, I stole from OpenSpace</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whoever shows up are the right people</li>
<li>Whenever it happens is the right time</li>
<li>Wherever it takes place is the right place</li>
<li>Whatever happens is the right thing to happen</li>
</ul>
<p>We learned a lot in each of the mob programming sessions. We interpreted programming commands from our team members, and gave our team members programming commands to interpret.</p>
<p>Sometimes we got stuck... usually we moved along at a slow, but steady pace.</p>
<p>If you want to create something cool, you don&#39;t have to wait for anyone to give you the go-ahead. You don&#39;t even have to try to create something cool. You&#39;ll probably do better if you just try to create something that you think is cool, or interesting, however small it is. Then build on it. Play with it a bit more the next day, or a week later, or even a year later.</p>
<p>Not every project you create is destined for huge success... but you don&#39;t need that from every project. If you learn a bit, it&#39;s worth it. Keep having fun, keep learning, keep doing cool stuff and telling people about it, and you&#39;ll develop a huge catalog of work. Some of it will seem like a big deal, and some of it will seem like small potatoes, but it all makes up the stepping stones leading to the very next thing you do...</p>
