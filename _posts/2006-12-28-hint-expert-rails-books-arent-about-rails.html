<p>I got my copy of the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/title/rails/">Agile Rails book, 2nd edition</a> in the mail today.  I didn&#8217;t feel any of the excitement that I did when I got the first edition or when I got <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/">Rails Recipes</a>.  Part of the reason is that I already have the PDF, so I&#8217;ve seen the book already.  More likely though is just that it&#8217;s a boring book.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the Daves have done an excellent job documenting Rails, and the book certainly doesn&#8217;t put you to sleep.  It&#8217;s just that if you&#8217;ve worked with Rails for a little while, there&#8217;s nothing new to find in this book.  Nothing that&#8217;s going to be of use, anyway.</p>
<p>The back of the book says it&#8217;s targeted for beginner developers all the way through experts.  I certainly agree that it&#8217;s accessible to new programmers, and it contains basically everything you could want to know about Rails.  So why do I say that there&#8217;s nothing new of use to experienced Rails developers?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to let the cat out of the bag.  This isn&#8217;t a book review.</p>
<h2>Rails Experts Are No Different From You And Me</h2>
<p>&#8230;at least when it comes to using Rails itself.</p>
<p>I know that I can change the table names of my models.  I don&#8217;t know exactly how, but I know that I can look in the AR::Base docs and find it.  I know that I can use composite primary keys.  There&#8217;s lots of esoteric stuff in Rails that I know is possible, but that I don&#8217;t know how to do off the top of my head.  I have a feeling that anyone who spends their time writing Rails apps is in the same boat.</p>
<p>We all know that Rails makes the mundane decisions for you.  I laugh when I see a forum post where someone asks how he should structure the directories in his PHP app.  Are you kidding me?  That means this guy is probably sitting around waiting for replies before he even creates directories.  Rails is simple.  You decide that you want to write a web app, and Rails takes care of the rest.  The only real decision is which database to use, and that&#8217;s easily reversible.</p>
<p>Good Rails developers realize that Rails takes away all the bullshit that everyone else deals with.  I have stacks and stacks of Java books&#8230;Struts, Spring, Hibernate, EJBs, Tomcat, blah blah blah.  There is so much literature on the infrastructure of writing web applications.  What&#8217;s left when you take away the need to understand and configure all that infrastructure?</p>
<p>Rails doesn&#8217;t have any expert books because it doesn&#8217;t require an expert to use Rails.  It takes an expert to develop amazing applications, but there&#8217;s nothing special about hooking up a Rails application.</p>
<p>Put simply, the expert way of using Rails is nearly always the same as the beginner way.</p>
<p>An expert-level Rails book would be an expert-level book on building applications.  It wouldn&#8217;t talk about infrastructure, it wouldn&#8217;t talk about scaling, it would talk about one thing - how to build interesting, valuable software.  There&#8217;s precious little literature on what it means to build valuable software.  The only book I&#8217;ve read that provides a worthwhile discussion is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/">Domain-Driven Design</a>, and I read a LOT of software books.</p>
<h2>My Job Didn&#8217;t Go To India!</h2>
<p>Rails, easy as it is, will ironically make things terribly difficult on both developers and technical writers.  They&#8217;re going to learn something that we all intrinsically know, yet have a tendency to deny.  Programming is HARD!  Syntax and configuration and conceptual weight is tough, but it all pales in comparison to the difficulty of actually solving business problems.  That&#8217;s where intelligence is needed.  That&#8217;s where creativity is needed.  The intellectual power necessary to create value out of nothing dwarfs the power needed to write some code.</p>
<p>I think a lot of programmers are going to find themselves looking for jobs in the coming years, and not because their jobs are getting sent to India.  In fact, fewer and fewer jobs will go to India for the same reason these guys will be out of jobs.  In the past, and increasingly less so now, the knowledge of how to configure different frameworks and technologies to play well together was mistaken for the ability to develop.  Programming jobs are filled with people who are more admins than developers.  With things like Rails obviating the need for these pradministrators, the jobs will go to the guys who know how to build valuable software.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t some doomsday prophecy.  Far from it, we&#8217;re poised for a software Renaissance.  Infrastructure and technical problems have been solved, giving us the time and freedom to work on interesting things.  For a developer, this is a very exciting time.</p>
