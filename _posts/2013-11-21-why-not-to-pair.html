<p><em>After 10 years in the game, I've finally managed to articulate the reasons why I feel it's not worth pair programming. Behold!</em></p>
<h3>It costs twice as much</h3>
<p>I get so frustrated when I board a plane and see two pilots in the cockpit. If airlines would stop paying two people for one job, maybe I could check my baggage for free.</p>
<p>Earlier this year I had ankle surgery, and there were five doctors in the operating room - FIVE! How does someone call himself a surgeon if he needs other people to help him perform a surgery? The operation set me back 10 grand...greedy bastards.  I could have gotten a pimped out Mac Pro with the money they overcharged me.</p>
<p>You can't tell me that it's a safety issue in aviation and surgery. Commercial airplanes are basically giant computers that fly themselves. They're not prone to drinking before flights and don't give in to terrorist demands in the petty hope of making it home alive to see their families. Navy corpsman have performed countless field surgeries with far less training and in far harsher conditions than the so-called "elite" surgeons that work in the comfort of sterile operating room.</p>
<h3>Problem solving is not a social activity</h3>
<p>I hate articulating problems to others and processing their feedback. It uses up valuable bandwidth that would be better dedicated to holing myself up and tinkering away until I come up with something to brilliant. Everyone knows that Crick was just a pain in Watson's neck.</p>
<h3>Learn on your own time, not on the job</h3>
<p>If you don't know exactly what to do at all times, you're really not qualified for the job in the first place. Go home and study until you get your skills up to snuff. All problems that arise in a software project can be avoided with a little more upfront analysis and design, so don't expect to be paid to figure things out.</p>
<h3>Develop software, not people</h3>
<p>Nobody mentored me, I had to learn this stuff the hard way through good old fashioned hard work. Unless other people go through that same process they won't appreciate the secrets of professional software development. I once spent 10 hours tracking down a syntax error, and I didn't even know what a syntax error was! That built character. Programmers these days give up too easily. No wonder they need crutches like automated tests and version control – if they spent more time making sure their code worked right they wouldn't need all those tests, and wouldn't feel the need to go back to an older version from time to time.</p>
<p>On the flip side, explaining things to others is just a waste of time for senior developers. They won't learn anything from someone who has different experiences. It's not worth seeing the programming world through the eyes of another person. Nobody ever deepened their understanding of a subject by teaching it to others. In fact they risk losing their expertise by being forced to water it down.</p>
<h3>Culture happens from the top-down</h3>
<p>When people work closely together, they risk forming bonds and working styles that differ from those outlined in the corporate culture handbook. They might start to spend their lunch breaks together, talking about non work-related things, and miss out on the team-building nerf gun fights &amp; foosball tournaments.</p>
<h3>Loss of personal freedom</h3>
<p>I love putting on headphones and listening to music when I program, but I can't do that when I pair. I have to share a stereo with the people around me and occasionally negotiate with them about what music we listen to. We have to take turns sharing equipment and space, and I'm forced to share a bit of another person's perspective.</p>
<p><em>Get on with your bad self, by yourself. I know I will.</em></p>
