<p>Late last week I read two articles about the problems that arise when companies use GitHub and open source as a way to evaluate job applicants. <a href="http://ashedryden.com/blog/the-ethics-of-unpaid-labor-and-the-oss-community">Ashe Dryden examines it from an ethical perspective</a>, arguing that it disproportionately favors white men, who already enjoy disproportionate favor. James Coglan argues that <a href="http://blog.jcoglan.com/2013/11/15/why-github-is-not-your-cv/">a GitHub profile doesn't say nearly as much about a person as some employers might think</a>. Both articles are worth reading if you haven't yet done so, and serve to help move our industry forward.</p>
<p>While reading the articles, particularly Ashe's, I couldn't take my mind off the obvious solution to a small part of the problem. If employers look at GitHub profiles…post something to GitHub.</p>
<p>Of course this does nothing to address the broader issues that Ashe and James discuss. That's a lot harder and will take time and effort, and I'm grateful for people like Ashe and others in the community who have dedicated their time and effort to increasing diversity and tolerance in the software community and the world at large. Unfortunately, change is slow, particularly when it comes to righting injustices against disadvantaged groups of people. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">Slavery was abolished in the United States less than 150 years ago</a>, but still <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_slavery">continues in parts of the world</a> (including in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking_in_the_United_States">US in the form of human trafficking</a>).</p>
<p>We absolutely must continue working to level the playing field in our community. GitHub helps do that by being a freely available service that allows you to connect with other people. Any problems that arise are not because of GitHub or open source, but from a culture that permits people to attack and threaten others because…well, I don't know why. If you've been paying attention, you'll realize that our culture doesn't actually permit that behavior at all – those people are assholes.</p>
<p>I understand that many people do not have time to dedicate to open source. That's fine. I think you can make a favorable impression on a potential employer by spending <a href="http://www.marcandangel.com/2010/10/04/30-ways-to-save-30-minutes-a-day/">5 minutes per day</a> posting something new to GitHub. I understand that many people might not want to have a public profile. In that case I suggest creating a semi-anonymous profile that you use only as a way to share code examples with potential employers. You might even explain to them why you aren't publicly active on GitHub – Ashe has provided plenty of examples.</p>
<p>I admit that as someone who has benefitted from my involvement in open source, and has used open source as one indicator when evaluating job applicants, I was not aware of and cannot fully relate to the problems that Ashe has brought up. I think this discussion gives us an opportunity to evaluate and improve hiring practices moving forward. I also think it's an opportunity for anyone – regardless of gender or race – to help themselves by posting some code. All it really takes to become an open source contributor is to <a href="https://github.com">share some code</a> and slap an <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/">open source license</a> on it. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drJWxMLrpE0">Hack the planet!</a></p>
