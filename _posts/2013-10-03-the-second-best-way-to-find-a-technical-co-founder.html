<p>Go to a meetup group. You'll need to attend as many meetup groups as you can. You're not trying to find someone on the first night. You're talking about someone who's going to be responsible for a major portion of your business. If you think you're going to find someone who fits the bill after an hour of conversation over burgers, you don't have the first idea what a technical co-founder will do for you.</p>
