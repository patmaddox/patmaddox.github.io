<p>I was doing some Christmas shopping today at Best Buy.  There was a bin full of DVDs for $4.99, so I grabbed one.  When I went to check out, the cashier rang it up and the screen showed $19.99.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was in the bin that says $4.99.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cashier looked over her shoulder, saw the bin that said $4.99, and overrode the price.</p>
<p>Contrast that with an experience I had at Wal-mart that was the same situation, but with an entirely different outcome.  When I told the WM employee that the item was on discount, he paged someone for verification (good), and then paged a manager for a price override (very very bad).</p>
<p>Both companies share a business rule that all retailers share - all items have a specified price. Sometimes an item is discounted but doesn&#8217;t show up in the system that way.  The difference is that one of them has a good implementation of this rule and the other has a crappy one.  This difference is the embodiment of the different approaches they take - serving people vs policing people.</p>
<p>A Best Buy cashier has a great system on her hands, a true <a href="http://jooto.com/blog/index.php/2005/12/27/how-to-recognize-a-smart-servant/">smart servant</a>.  She scans the items and 99% of the time things are lovely.  Occasionally the price won&#8217;t be right, in which case she can correct it immediately.  In short, the system makes her job easier and faster, while unquestioningly deferring to her better judgment.</p>
<p>Of course you could say that a Wal-mart employee has the same system on his hands, he just has to call upon someone with more authority.  But have you ever noticed the difference in intelligence between the average cashier at Wal-mart and the average cashier at Best Buy?</p>
