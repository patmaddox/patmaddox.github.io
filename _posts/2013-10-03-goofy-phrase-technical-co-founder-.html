<p>what's the point? I went to a startup mixer where half a dozen people introduced me as, "I'm so and so, I run a company that does such and such, I'm here to make connections and meet like-minded people, but most of all I hope to find a technical co-founder."</p>
<p>It was so repetitive and annoying that I had no choice but to down a few stiff drinks and make a game of it. I introduced myself to people straight off the bat as, "I'm Pat, I'm looking for a non-technical co-founder" with the goal of getting as many business cards as I could that evening. People definitely looked at me funny and would confuse what I said, thinking that I'm non-technical and looking for a technical co-founder. I don't know if that's because so many people were the non-technical folks, or they thought it strange that I would show up with nothing to offer but technical acumen and a desire to use it for good. They on the other hand bring the vision and the connections, and just need to find a technical sort of person to build it all.</p>
<p>It doesn't work like that in 2013, where your customers interact with you via email and praise you or talk shit about you on twitter and facebook. It doesn't work like that when you want to participate in social media and interact with the multitude of services that have become a part of our every day lives. It doesn't work like that when you want to open up your services beyond your initial offering and provide APIs. You don't have to be a nerd, and you don't have to be responsible or even know about technical details past a certain point. But at the beginning, when you have an idea and connections, and what stands between you and a successful business is simply a *concrete product with paying customers*, and learning a bit of technology will empower you to create that product and serve those customers, then learning that technology will be immediately useful. Because you go through the experience yourself, you will be able to evaluate potential partners or employees who may perform this work, and you will value their contributions empathically.</p>
