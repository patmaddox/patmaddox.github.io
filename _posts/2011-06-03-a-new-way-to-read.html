<p>Back in <a href="digital-reading-revolution-how-i-like-to-read-books.html">The digital reading revolution: How I like to read books, DRMed content, and the future of publishing</a>, I outlined how I approach reading and taking notes on books (aka &#8220;studying&#8221;). I also talked about ways in which I&#8217;d like to improve my reading process. Last night I decided to take a step in that direction.</p>
<p>To recap, I read both analog and digital books. I prefer reading on Kindle. I buy directly from the publisher when I can, because they usually offer a PDF download bundle. When I can&#8217;t find a book in kindle format, I buy the paper copy.</p>
<p>Whether I&#8217;m reading on my kindle or riffling through pages, I usually read a book more than once. First I&#8217;ll read through it quickly, without stopping, even if I don&#8217;t understand parts. I bookmark those as difficult sections and move on. I don&#8217;t make many notes at this point â€“ just a few highlights here and there to indentify the author&#8217;s assertions and supporting facts and anecdotes.</p>
<p>After a quick first pass, I flip back through the book and take a look at my notes. These clues help me understand the book&#8217;s important points. I reconstruct the author&#8217;s arguments by stitching together the highlighted parts. I can tell the solid arguments from the flimsy ones at a glance. The Kindle makes this sort of note-rearranging a breeze because I can import the highlights into my computer [1].</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t always take great notes. A lot of the time, I don&#8217;t care enough to develop a complete understanding of that particular book at that particular moment. It&#8217;s good enough to mentally index the key themes and structure of the book, and let my computer do the boring task of remembering the actual words. Then I&#8217;ve got more energy to do the fun part, the part that only I can do: unlocking the author&#8217;s secrets when the time is right.</p>
<p>This works great for digital books, but analog requires more work. I often have vague notions of an idea or fact that I remember reading, but can&#8217;t remember which book it came from. Sadly, I can&#8217;t google my book shelves [2]. Until now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001XWCQO2">fancy Scansnap S1500M</a> that I use to scan documents into DEVONthink. <a href="http://devon-technologies.com/files/screenshots/devonthink/devonthink-1.jpg">DEVONthink</a> OCRs the documents and then proposes possible filing locations. I&#8217;d like to use DT&#8217;s powerful search on my book shelf. Yesterday I took a couple of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1307088458&amp;sr=1-1">old</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eat-Drink-Be-Healthy-Harvard/dp/0743266420/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1307088785&amp;sr=1-1">books</a> to Office Depot and had them slice off the bindings. Then I scanned the books for DT to archive. I&#8217;ll save the details for another post, but the bottom line is that for $2.50 at Office Depot &amp;  15 minutes baby-sitting the scanner, I can take any book from my bookshelf and have all of its contents instantly searchable on my laptop.</p>
<p>Slicing a book in order to scan it felt weird at first, but it felt great to toss the pages into the recycling bin after scanning. Books (<i>computer</i> books especially) are heavy and a pain to move and take up space in my house. My entire library will fit on my laptop! I can load books onto my kindle or iPad for extra portability. If I want to go old school, I can print out the pages I want to read and fold them into my back pocket. I did the same thing with a few brand new books. After scanning the pages, I stapled the chapters separately. They look and feel like digests.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty excited about this new approach. I can highlight the paper copy more aggressively and dispose of it when I&#8217;m done. My computer holds onto the master copy and makes it searchable for me. I have some ideas of how this approach could change my reading habits, but for now I&#8217;m going to just run with it and see what happens.</p>

<p>[1] On the flip side, transcribing notes by hand adds <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning">sensory experience</a> which can improve your ability to recall information.</p>
<p>[2] Google Books has its shortcomings. It can&#8217;t constrain its search to my bookshelf. Deep study is difficult due to missing pages.</p>
