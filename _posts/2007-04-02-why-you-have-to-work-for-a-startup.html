<p>Paul Graham writes lots of articles on why you should work for a startup, or why you shouldn&#8217;t not start a startup, or whatever.  I&#8217;m pretty sure if you google &#8220;Paul Graham&#8221; you&#8217;ll find the dude I&#8217;m talking about, so no link necessary.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the bottom line though - it&#8217;s fucking cool.  I think a lot of people get too serious in their lives and stop trying to do something cool.  I mean come on, we&#8217;re taking man-made machines that traditionally speak ones and zeros, but we write code in a <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">sexy language</a> and some stuff happens.</p>
<p>THAT&#8217;S SO COOL!!</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s not your reaction, you shouldn&#8217;t be a programmer.  You should be a lawyer or something.</p>
<p>The reason you should own/work for a startup is cause you get to work on cool stuff.  There&#8217;s no risk mitigation&#8230;everybody knows that simply being in business is risky enough, the software you build is nowhere near as risky.  When you&#8217;re not worried about playing it safe (<a href="http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/pic/adc/10101638A~John-Travolta-Grease-Posters.jpg">I got a rep to protect</a>), you can just focus on creative, cool stuff.</p>
<p>I work for a <a href="http://www.twistage.com/">cool ass startup</a> and I have a lot of fun&#8230;my bosses kick ass, but it turns out that they&#8217;re still bosses.  I <i>hate</i> being told what to do.  Most of the time I don&#8217;t worry about it, I get a lot of free reign (thanks Dave(s)).  But still there&#8217;s a percentage of my time where I&#8217;m the bitch.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t even imagine what it&#8217;d be like if I worked at <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2005/07/why-you-need-degree-to-work-for-bigco.html">BigCo</a>.  It&#8217;d be fucking HORRENDOUS.</p>
<p>It probably looks like I don&#8217;t have a point here.  I do though, I promise.  Programming is a <b>cool ass</b> job, and if your job isn&#8217;t cool, you&#8217;re missing out.  Fix it.  The best way is of course to start a startup.  If that&#8217;s too much, join a startup.</p>
