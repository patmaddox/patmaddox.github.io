<p>Hackers, pretty much by definition, are interested in useful, creative things.  InfoQ has some good hackers on staff (including Obie Fernandez, who has as much professional Ruby influence as anyone by being the Ruby editor for a series of AWPress books).  Which is why I was so disappointed that InfoQ published <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/04/no-compromise-stateful-row">an interview with DHH and Avi Bryant</a>, two high-profile hackers in the Ruby and Smalltalk world, lacking entirely in usefulness and creativity.</p>
<p>My first issue with this article lies in the closing paragraph, which basically sums up what a mindless interview this was:</p>
<div class="quote"><q>However is it not too late for Seaside and Smalltalk?</q></div>
<p>I don&#8217;t even know what it means to be &#8220;too late&#8221; for a language and web framework.  Too late to become the be-all-end-all tool for web development?  It can never be too late, because there&#8217;s never an opportunity for it to happen in the first place!  Too late to become a useful tool for web development?  Usefulness has a shelf life that is reached only when something of substantially more usefulness arrives to take its place.  Anyone who&#8217;s used Ruby and Smalltalk can see that neither is substantially more useful than the other.  If anything, Ruby is moving closer to <i>being</i> Smalltalk, not replacing it.  Smalltalk has been useful for longer than I&#8217;ve been alive.</p>
<p>The author seems intent on pitting Rails vs Smalltalk.  Why?  <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html">Open source has shown us that good ideas and technologies survive on their own merits</a>, while bad ones die off.  If Rails delivers a crushing blow to Seaside, or vice versa, it will be because the hackers found incredible value in and were able to produce incredible value with one framework and not the other.  Not because a technojournalist wrote a boring VS column.</p>
<p>What really bugs me though is what a huge opportunity was wasted.  We all had a chance to really get inside the minds of a couple great hackers with drastically different ideas on how to build software.  Yet instead of learning what these ideas are, we basically got DHH saying, &#8220;everyone is different.&#8221;  That would have been useful had I skipped second grade, but it turns out that I didn&#8217;t, so I was told something I learned 15 years ago.  Awesome.  I can just see DHH&#8217;s eyes glazing over right away, forcing himself to be polite for the remainder of the interview.</p>
<p>DHH says that he loves working with the web, with the &#8220;architectural patterns offered by HTTP and REST&#8221;.  He says that moving forward we can embrace the constraints posed by the web to build software that&#8217;s completely different from desktop applications.  I want to know what he personally sees in the web that&#8217;s so much better than what desktop apps can offer.  What kinds of new applications can we build?  <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000593.html">In his initial article on REST</a>, he said he asked himself the question what if he could model the whole world as CRUD?  It&#8217;s an interesting question, but I&#8217;m even more interested in why.  I personally think it&#8217;s because he believes it leads to more simple and beautiful code, and he values that highly, but my speculations aren&#8217;t nearly as fulfilling as his explanations.</p>
<p>Avi on the other hand seems to view the web as an RPC layer.  Not the crappy RPC that most of us come up with, but a platform for building stateful, behavior-rich components.  I think it&#8217;s plainly obvious that Avi Bryant sees the web completely different from most people, considering that <a href="http://www.dabbledb.com/">Seaside&#8217;s crowning achievement</a> is unlike anything else you can find on the web today.  Maybe he doesn&#8217;t even see a real separation between the desktop and web, instead dreaming of a world where it&#8217;s all one big platform.</p>
<p>These are the kinds of things that I want to know.  It&#8217;s sheer curiosity.  I want to know how stuff works.  I want to know how people think.  I want to know what goes on inside the minds of people smarter than me.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s even a practical side for people who don&#8217;t find value in curiosity&#8217;s sake.  If you invest your time, energy, and money into a technology, don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s a good idea to understand the fundamental motivations behind that technology?  You can more easily understand how a tool can solve your problem.  You can perform a pragmatic, economic comparison of <a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2007/04/restle-mania.html">X vs Y</a>.  You understand the philosophy of a particular tool, enabling you to work in harmony with it instead of against it.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;m incredibly interested in how they differ in what the culture of software development should be, not just the means of construction.  They both seem to me like software hippies.  DHH is living in his own little fantasy world, inviting people in to come and enjoy themselves.  Avi is a disconnected observer, frustrated as he watches a broken world.  If only they saw what he sees.</p>
<p>I was so excited to see an interview with DHH and Avi.  Maybe I&#8217;d finally have a peek through the eyes of those two.  I&#8217;d gain a broader and deeper understanding of the possibilities when developing for the web.  I&#8217;d have a little bit of guidance on the path towards enlightenment.  Guess I still have to find my own way.</p>
