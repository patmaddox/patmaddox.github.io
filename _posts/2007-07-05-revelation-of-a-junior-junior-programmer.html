<p><i><a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/">Reg Braithwaite</a> is one of my absolute favorite bloggers.  He gets into <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/02/haskell-ruby-and-infinity.html">nitty gritty code</a>, and discusses the <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/06/still-failing-still-learning.html">people process of building software</a> on a high level.  I hope that some day I&#8217;ll be able to write even a fraction of the stuff he does about software development and management.  Here&#8217;s my first story.</i></p>
<p>I just went through my first breakdown as a programmer.  My bosses told me it&#8217;s happened to them, it&#8217;ll happen to me, don&#8217;t worry about it.  Their job is just to delay it for as long as possible, and make it as painless as possible when it does happen.  Yes you&#8217;re a young stud, but young studs burn out too.</p>
<p>Well it hit me.  Not like I thought it would though.  I didn&#8217;t work too hard or too long.  I just got disconnected from my team.</p>
<p>In the beginning it was really easy.  We basically started with a clean slate.  Every day I&#8217;d talk with my teammates, we&#8217;d check in code, and slowly (actually, pretty quickly ;) our app grew closer to what we imagined.  It felt great, making tons of progress each day and knowing it was vital to our company.</p>
<p>Then we started getting customers.  Gradually we let people in.  Sites started popping up, powered by our platform.  This is great, right?  Despite what my girlfriend might say, I&#8217;m not writing this code for my personal amusement.  We build software so that people can use it.</p>
<p>But something happened, and as it turns out, the problem is that something wasn&#8217;t happening around me.  Now our conference calls revolve around what&#8217;s going on with particular customers.  Who&#8217;s launching when, new deals with providers - the kinds of things that are important and good as a business.</p>
<p>It all just seems so far away though.  I know that it&#8217;s not possible without the work I&#8217;ve done.  And it&#8217;s certainly the direction we need to go in.  It all just seems so far away.  If I could just grab a beer with my coworkers at the end of the day, I&#8217;d feel I&#8217;m a part of what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to chalk this up to immaturity.  It seems pretty simple, now that I&#8217;ve had a chance to go through it.  Don&#8217;t lose sight of the ultimate goal.  Just because things have exploded in size and scope doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m not a part of it anymore.  I should be just as happy to know that Client X was ecstatic about Feature Y as I was about watching our app materialize out of nothing.</p>
<p>It can be easy to lose some of the feeling of being a team.  Especially when the goals go from focused and concrete to huge and abstract.  However that&#8217;s when it becomes most important to come together as a strong team - concrete goals are relatively easy and can be solved with enough elbow grease.  It takes an intelligent, cooperative team to realize the vision we&#8217;ve created for ourselves.</p>
<p>Fortunately I&#8217;m proud to work with some awesome people.  I&#8217;m looking forward to being a part of that team again.</p>
