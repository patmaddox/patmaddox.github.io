<p>Look in the mirror! YOU are the person best able to make this vision happen, I guarantee it. You're so early on in the company's phase that you don't even realize it. You don't want to commit to technical decisions now, because you have very little information about the business at this point. Your ignorance and fear are an asset. You will build something that works, and not be precious about it, and be able to hand it off to somebody else to maintain or rebuild as you learn more about the business.</p>
