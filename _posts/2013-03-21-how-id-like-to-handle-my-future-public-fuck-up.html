<p>I'm still a relatively young guy, I speak my mind, and I have a lot to learn about the world. This means that I will almost certainly fuck up in a public context. Not because I'm inherently a dick, but because I'm inherently human and make mistakes. When you see me fuck up, here's what I'd like you to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>get up and leave if you find it that offensive</li>
<li>track me down and address me in private</li>
<li>have an earnest conversation with me and allow me to think things through</li>
</ul>
<p>Should you decide to call me out publicly, which is totally your right, then please do it immediately. Raise your hand, grab a microphone, or just shout out. Whatever it takes. I will take it in stride as best I can. I will say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I hadn't considered that. I will be mindful of this for the remainder of my time here. Can we please meet up afterward to discuss this in detail so I can understand where you're coming from?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After said conversation, I will make a public apology if I feel it is warranted.</p>
<p>That's it. I don't expect this to work for everyone, and I don't expect it to play out like this. I do want to put this out there in the hopes that folks with whom I share time and space can give each other the benefit of the doubt once in a while and learn from one another.</p>
