<p>Learning a new programming language is never easy. You have to learn new syntax,<br />
tools, and libraries. You make use of what you already know in order to<br />
understand new things, but sometimes what you know can make it harder to<br />
understand a new concept.</p>
<p>I've noticed that this applies especially to people who are learning their<br />
second programming language. Becoming a programmer already warps your brain<br />
enough - when you discover that what you've learned is just one of many<br />
different ways to think about solving programming problems, it can be tough to<br />
handle. I have seen professional programmers of ten years baffled by things like<br />
blocks in Ruby. Now I'll be the first to claim fault with my teaching, but<br />
I've used those same teaching methods with people who have never studied<br />
programming and they've been able to get it. I am certain it is not that the<br />
professional programmers are bad at what they do, but that their thinking is so<br />
ingrained that they literally can't accept the idea when I show them something<br />
radically different from what they already know.</p>
<p>Whether you're learning your second language or your twentieth, here's what I<br />
suggest: as you work, and as you go through documentation and educational<br />
materials, make a list of EVERYTHING. Every function, every library, every tool,<br />
every concept. Build up that list for the first week or two, don't do anything<br />
with it. Then go through the list, and map everything on it to things you<br />
already know. What do you know about how strings work? What do you know about<br />
order of operations? Networking? Exception Handling? Now you have a list of<br />
things that the language has that you're familiar with. It also represents a<br />
starting off point for investigating further - you've identified similarities<br />
with this language and other languages you know, but now you need to learn how<br />
it differs. You don't want your knowledge of another language to incorrectly<br />
prejudice your understanding of the new one.</p>
<p>Additionally, you'll have a list of things that don't map up to anything you<br />
know. This represents even more learning opportunities, ones you may struggle<br />
with. Keep your head up - it's okay if it's hard. It is a brand new part<br />
of your mental universe, after all!</p>
