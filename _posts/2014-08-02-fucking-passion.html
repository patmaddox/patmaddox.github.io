<p>I had a talk with a mentor of mine today in which I dropped the f bomb a couple times. He didn't say anything, but I paused and asked if he was offended when I used it. He said no, he's not offended. He said I didn't need to use it though, and that he doesn't use it. If he stops talking to me, I'd know why. He would be offended if I called him a &quot;fucking idiot.&quot;</p>
<p>I realized then that I'd never seen or heard him swear, and that once again he was just doing his thing and modeling a behavior he finds useful.</p>
<p>I thought about why I use &quot;fuck&quot; in my speech and writing, maybe because I'm caught up in something or maybe in an attempt to indicate how passionate I am.</p>
<p>In this case, I didn't need to be aggressive to indicate my passion. He knows of the time and energy I'd already put into it. He knows of my intentions for the future. He knows of my decision to share all of that with him as we talked. He already saw and understood the passion in the story. I didn't have to aggressively make him aware of it in that moment.</p>
<hr />
<p>I've thought about passion and what people mean by it when they say you need it to be successful, or they're looking for it from people they hire. I've seen people wonder what it means for them. If you don't go home and code every day after your job, and on the weekends, are you not &quot;passionate enough&quot; for someone?</p>
<p>I think I've developed a helpful rubrik for trying to understand my own passions. I ask myself:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have I dedicated a part of my life to this?</li>
<li>Do I have intentions for the future?</li>
<li>Am I willing to share with others what I've done, what I'm doing, and what I intend to do?</li>
</ol>
<p>It's not perfect, but it helps me. Perhaps it will help you. Perhaps the next time you wonder if you meet someone else's definition of passion, you can communicate to them what you've done and what you intend to do. It doesn't matter what it is. You could be skipping rocks for all I care. If someone doesn't see the passion in your story, they're probably not the right people for you.</p>
