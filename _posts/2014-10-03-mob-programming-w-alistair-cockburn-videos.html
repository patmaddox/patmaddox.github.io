<p>Alistair Cockburn joined the RubySteps mob this week to learn Ruby, practice TDD, and experiment with some of his design ideas. We had a blast and learned a lot - and wrote some pretty cool software to boot! I'm thrilled to have Alistair join our <a href="https://github.com/mob/mob_rotation/blob/master/Contributors.md">growing contributors list</a> and to get some RubySteps members in on <a href="https://github.com/totheralistair/SmallWebHexagon/blob/master/Contributors.md">one of his projects</a> as well.</p>
<p>We recorded the sessions for your viewing pleasure.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_Gw1vz6R0I">RubySteps mob_rotation session A</a> we added a help command to our <a href="https://github.com/mob/mob_rotation">mob_rotation software</a>. It was another nice example of test-driving new functionality, and we had some interesting design discussions along the way.</p>
<p>We followed that up with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOrOZir3cbc">RubySteps mob_rotation session B</a> where we continued our work on <code>mob_rotation</code> and added an exciting new feature - a timer to tell us when it's time to rotate! This session was particularly fun because I thought it would be tricky to test, and we managed to add the feature with a couple clear tests and just a few lines of production code. Awesome! The audio is rough for the first few minutes, but we get there.</p>
<p>Alistair wanted to experiment with his <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture">Hexagonal Architecture</a>, so in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95MQu0Fvhw4">Hexagonal Architecture session A</a> we played around with defining a port for loading data from a data source, and created an adapter to load from an in-memory data source. You can see our work up on his <a href="https://github.com/totheralistair/SmallWebHexagon/">SmallWebHexagon project</a>.</p>
<p>Continuing along, we used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jYzghm3FCU">Hexagonal Architecture session B</a> to save new data to an in-memory data store. Then we moved on to file-based data storage...and got stuck for the first time. Hey, it happens! We still had great design discussion.</p>
