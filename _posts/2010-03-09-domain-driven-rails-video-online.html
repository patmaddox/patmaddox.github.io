<p><em>tl;dr</em>: <a href="http://www.alohaonrails.com/2010/02/20/domain-driven-rails-by-pat-maddox-video-now-online/">video is here</a>.  The slides are included in the video (so cool!) but you can also <a href="http://patmaddox.s3.amazonaws.com/aloha2009.pdf">download the PDF version</a></p>
<p>Last October I got to go to Aloha on Rails and as you would expect from a Rails conference hosted in Hawaii it was AAAAWWWWWEEEEESSSSSOOOOOMMMMMEEEE.</p>
<p>I gave a talk called &#8220;Domain-Driven Rails&#8221; which I retitled on the fly to &#8220;The Evolution of Rails as viewed through a Theory of Constraints perspective&#8221; (or something thereabouts).</p>
<p>It starts off with a look at the different phases in Rails&#8217; evolution, with the phases defined by the most important problem (greatest constraint) at the time.  So Rails came into existence first to solve DHH&#8217;s pain point of having to write X implementation and Y mapping files every time he wanted to add a new database table.  Once that was figured out we moved on to getting even more code out quickly, which came in the form of generators.  Those worked for a while but upgrading became a PITA and so we used more frameworks and metaprogramming techniques to get the benefits of generated code but without the pain.  We&#8217;ve got a pretty good handle on all that and  now we&#8217;re running into different constraints: complexity of the model, persistence choices, etc.</p>
<p>Those are just a few of the points.  I also pick apart a couple of code examples in which I make a case for abandoning some of the tricks you&#8217;ve taken for granted over the past year or two.</p>
<p>So <a href="http://www.alohaonrails.com/2010/02/20/domain-driven-rails-by-pat-maddox-video-now-online/">check it out</a>!  I had a lot of fun presenting.  It&#8217;s not perfect, and I&#8217;d be happy to discuss any feedback you&#8217;ve got from watching it.  If you enjoy it, look for my <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/schedule/detail/14230">followup presentation at RailsConf 2010 in Baltimore</a>.</p>
<p>Also big thanks to <a href="http://sethladd.com/">Seth Ladd</a> for running the DOPEST CONFERENCE EVAR as well as responding to my challenge to put the video up online sooner rather than later.  Mahalo, dude</p>
