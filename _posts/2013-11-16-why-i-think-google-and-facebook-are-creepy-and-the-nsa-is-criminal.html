<p>My dad and I love to talk politics. After Edward Snowden leaked his information about the NSA's massive spy campaign against American citizens, we had plenty to talk about. My dad has been a Navy officer for nearly 30 years, has served overseas for a third of that time including a tour in Iraq, and currently lives overseas. The words "Obama", "Congress", "war", and "terrorism" regularly come up in our conversations. I suspect that our phone calls get "flagged," whatever that means. I'm okay with that. My dad knows some shit that neither I nor the US government want him sharing, and of course he never would. When he signed up for the military he chose to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Code_of_Military_Justice">sacrifice some of his Constitutional rights</a> in order to protect mine and yours.</p>
<p>When we first talked about NSA's prism program, he argued that companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have been collecting information on their users for years, and exploiting it for profit. He's absolutely right. I find it disgusting and creepy, and I think that this profit-above-all-else mentality we've come to adopt in the US is diminishing in social acceptability. I hope that over time we choose to legislate such activity in order to protect people's personal information.</p>
<p>NSA's Prism, on the other hand, is criminal.</p>
<p>What's the difference? Google &amp; Facebook are companies that I can choose to engage. I had a Facebook account, now I don't. I used to be a user and champion of all things Google, now I keep my distance. I can't do anything about our past history – they have info on me and will do with it what they see fit – but I can choose not to give them any more info from this day forward. I can opt out. Not so with Prism. I have absolutely no power there – the NSA collects whatever information they like without being accountable to anyone. They use American tax dollars to observe the behaviors and communications of the very taxpaying citizens that until recently have unwittingly funded their own surveillance. I consider such surveillance to clearly be a chilling effect on freedom of speech, a threat to our Constitutional freedom. That's before we go down the slippery slope of what <a href="http://cle.ens-lyon.fr/anglais/the-state-and-surveillance-fear-and-control-131675.kjsp?STNAV=&amp;RUBNAV=&amp;RH=CDL_ANG100100">corrupt governments have historically done with the information they obtain from surveilling their citizens</a>.</p>
<p>With Google &amp; Facebook, I have a rational choice: I can decide that I get enough value from their services to justify sharing my personal information, or not. With Prism, I am forced into an irrational choice: call bullshit on my government and help our nation change (good), go with the flow and accept the chilling effect of a government that spies on its citizens (weak sauce), or renounce my citizenship (decidedly un-American). Our nation was founded on a principle of freedom of choice, and for nearly two and a half centuries has served as an example of the power and importance of that freedom. We may have gotten off track recently, but I'm optimistic about our ability to regain our American principles and be a good example to and citizen of the global community. Ending unchecked surveillance against law-abiding citizens will be a massive step in that direction.</p>
