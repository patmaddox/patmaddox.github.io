<p><strong>Update</strong>: We've scheduled a date and time for the session. <a href="http://www.enginehere.com/stream/373/rspec-tdd-bdd-office-hours-with-pat-maddox-nov-20/">Get the details here</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>I got an email the other day asking if I'd be interested in hosting RSpec office hours using <a href="http://enginehere.com">enginehere.com</a>. I love thinking and talking about this stuff, and when I checked out EngineHere I found a platform that looks like it makes it really easy for a group of developers to talk shop and argue about code. Here's what we can do on EngineHere:</p>
<ul>
<li>live text &amp; audio chat</li>
<li>live edit &amp; run code</li>
<li>live stack overflow-style q&amp;a w/ voting &amp; discussion</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically it's for doing stuff live! Combining the different ways that developers communicate into a tool that makes live communication as simple as longer-cycle asynchronous communication. Kinda like what Google Wave was supposed to be, only useful :)</p>
<p>I expect a lively discussion...I wonder if digital medium means we'll break the record for shortest time before someone brings up mocks and all hell breaks loose. It'll be an open forum, we'll talk about whatever people want to talk about, but I'll guide it as best I can from my experience in software testing and working with people to study and improve their own practices.</p>
<p>The hangout is totally free, and signup takes 10 seconds via github. Ben, the guy who built EngineHere, said he's got a few kinks to work out before we can do it, so I'm guessing it'll be a couple weeks.Â If you want to participate, there are three ways I can notify you of the details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="feed://patmaddox.com/feed/">subscribe to this blog's feed</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/patmaddox">follow me on twitter</a></li>
<li><a href="mailto:patmaddox@me.com">send me an email</a> and I'll add your info to a text file which will be used only to announce the details, and then burned</li>
</ul>
<p>Tell your friends, bring a loved one, it's gonna be a good time!</p>
