<p><a href="http://www.coreyhaines.com/">Corey Haines</a> is a good friend of mine, and as some of you know last year he went on his <a href="http://programmingtour.blogspot.com/">Pair Programming Journeyman&#8217;s Tour</a>.  I&#8217;ve said to myself numerous times, &#8220;one of these days I&#8217;m going to sell up all of my stuff, pack my dogs up in an RV and travel around the country Corey Haines style.&#8221;  I keep waiting for the right time, but my dogs would be hell to deal with, as would my girlfriend who is not fond of me skipping town for 6-8 weeks, even if it is to hang out with a bunch of computer nerds.  So the other day I thought what if I didn&#8217;t make such a radical lifestyle change, and instead just made week-long visits to various programming shops or folks that I&#8217;m interested in working with.  I brought that up with Nicole before going to bed and she liked that idea much more than my RV adventure, and that was that.</p>
<p>Well today I&#8217;m happy to say that it&#8217;s about to begin, or maybe is already underway.  The amazing <a href="http://testobsessed.com/">Elisabeth Hendrickson</a> is hosting me for a week at her Agilistry studio to continue work on a demo project she made for GoGaRuCo.</p>
<h3>Maybe I can visit you?</h3>
<p>Agilistry is my first stop on this new programming tour.  Next up is&#8230;well, I haven&#8217;t looked that far ahead yet :)  I have a couple places in mind that I&#8217;ll get in contact with.  In the mean time, if you know of any cool places that I could work at for a short time and learn some new stuff, shoot me an email at <a href="http://twitter.com/patmaddox">my twitter handle</a>@me.com</p>
<p>Just so you know what I&#8217;ve got in mind, my plan would be to work alongside you and/or your team for a week.  I&#8217;m trying to get exposure to new environments, be around smart people, etc.  I won&#8217;t doing this for pay.  That said, I can&#8217;t afford to fly all over the country, so I&#8217;d give strong preference to anybody wanting to cover my expenses.  So if you&#8217;re</p>
<ol>
<li>Really cool</li>
<li>Interested in working with me for a week</li>
<li>Can cover my flight / accommodations / food </li>
</ol>
<p>then let&#8217;s get in touch!</p>
